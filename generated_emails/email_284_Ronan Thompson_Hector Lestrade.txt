Hey Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplatface. I've been working on the game's physics engine, and I think we have something really special here. The game is a physics-based platformer where players control a character who can jump, slide, and bounce around the environment to collect coins and avoid obstacles. The levels are all procedurally generated, so each playthrough is unique.

I think this game has the potential to be a big hit, but I need your help to get the word out there. I've put together a marketing plan, but I would love your input. Can we set up a time to chat this week?

Thanks,
Ronan
