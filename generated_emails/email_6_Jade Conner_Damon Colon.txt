Hi Damon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming art budget for the new game we're working on. As you know, we're planning to invest heavily in art assets for this game, so I wanted to get your input on how we can allocate the budget most effectively.

I've attached a spreadsheet with a breakdown of the proposed budget. I've also included some notes on each line item.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the budget and any suggestions you have for how we can improve it. Please let me know if you have any questions.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Jade
