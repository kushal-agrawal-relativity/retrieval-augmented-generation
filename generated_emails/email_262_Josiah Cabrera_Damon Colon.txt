Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any availability this week to chat about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game. I'd love to get your input on the creative direction and make sure we're on the same page.

I'm free on Monday and Wednesday from 10-11am, and Tuesday and Thursday from 2-3pm. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Josiah
