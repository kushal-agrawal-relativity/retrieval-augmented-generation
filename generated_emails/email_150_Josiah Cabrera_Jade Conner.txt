Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we could do a social media campaign, where we encourage people to share videos of themselves playing the game. We could also run some paid ads, targeting people who are interested in action games.

I'm also considering doing a PR campaign, where we reach out to gaming journalists and get them to write about the game. I think this would be a great way to generate some buzz and get people excited about Splatty McSplat.

I'm open to other ideas, so please let me know what you think. I'm also happy to discuss this further in person if you'd like.

Thanks,
Josiah
