Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming product launch. I'm concerned that we're not on track to meet our deadline, and I wanted to see if we could brainstorm some ways to get back on track.

I think the biggest challenge is that we're still waiting on the final designs from the art team. I know they're working hard, but I'm worried that we're going to run out of time.

I think we have a few options. We could either push back the launch date, or we could try to find a way to get the designs finished faster. I'm not sure which option is better, but I think we need to make a decision soon.

I'm open to any suggestions you have. Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
