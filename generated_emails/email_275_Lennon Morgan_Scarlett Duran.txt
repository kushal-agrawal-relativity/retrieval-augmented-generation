Hi Scarlett,

I'm Lennon, the Network Administrator here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm writing to you today to see if you have any plans to make any changes to the game's network architecture in the near future.

I've been doing some performance monitoring, and I've noticed that the game's network traffic has been increasing steadily over the past few months. I'm concerned that this could lead to performance issues in the future, so I wanted to get ahead of it and see if there's anything we can do to improve the network's performance.

I'm happy to work with you on this, and I can provide you with any data or information you need. Just let me know if you're interested in working together.

Thanks,
Lennon
