Hi Josiah,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Spintendo Gizzard. As you know, this is a critical project for the company, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to make it a success.

I've been thinking about the best way to approach this campaign, and I think that we need to focus on two key areas:

* **Creating a buzz**. We need to get people excited about our game before it's even released. We can do this by creating a lot of pre-release hype, through social media, influencer marketing, and other channels.
* **Targeting the right audience**. We need to make sure that our marketing is targeted at the people who are most likely to be interested in our game. This means understanding our target audience and creating content that appeals to them.

I'm confident that we can achieve these goals if we work together. I'm looking forward to discussing this further with you and getting your input.

Best,
Victor
