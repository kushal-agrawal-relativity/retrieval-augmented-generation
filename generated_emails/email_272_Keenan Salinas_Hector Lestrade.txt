Hi Hector,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Spintendo Gizzard. I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your feedback before I put anything in motion.

I'm thinking that we could do a social media campaign, where we promote the game on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. We could also run some ads on Google and YouTube. I think it would be a good idea to create a landing page for the game, where people can sign up for a newsletter and get updates on the release date.

I'm also open to other ideas, so please let me know if you have anything you think would be a good fit.

I'm hoping to get this campaign started as soon as possible, so if you could get back to me with your thoughts by the end of the week, that would be great.

Thanks,
Keenan
