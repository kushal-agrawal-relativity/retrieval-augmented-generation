Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to see if you'd be available to chat about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game. I'd love to get your input on the creative direction and make sure that we're on the same page.

Do you have some time in the next few days to meet up? I'm free on Monday afternoon or Wednesday morning.

Let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Hector
