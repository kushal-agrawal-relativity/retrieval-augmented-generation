Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming launch of our new game, Splat-o-Rama. As you know, this is our most ambitious project to date, and we're expecting a lot of interest from players.

I'm concerned that we're not doing enough to promote the game in advance of the launch. I think we need to do a better job of getting the word out there, and I'm hoping you can help us with that.

Do you have any ideas for how we can generate more excitement about the game? I'm open to any suggestions.

I'm also wondering if you can help us with the marketing budget. We're going to need to spend some money to get people's attention, and I want to make sure we're using it wisely.

Can you take a look at our budget and let me know if you have any suggestions?

Thanks,
Keenan
