Hi Wilma,

I'm sending you a quick update on the PR campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. We've been getting some great press coverage, and I think we're on track to meet our sales goals.

I'm particularly excited about the article in The New York Times. The reviewer called Splatty McSplat "a must-have for any gamer". That's a huge endorsement, and it's going to help us reach a wider audience.

I'm also happy to report that we've already sold over 100,000 copies of Splatty McSplat. That's more than we sold of our previous game, and it's still early days. I think we're on track to have a major hit on our hands.

I'll keep you updated on our progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,
Hector
