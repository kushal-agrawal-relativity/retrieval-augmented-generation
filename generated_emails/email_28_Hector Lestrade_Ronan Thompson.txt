Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Quest. As you know, this is a big game for us, and we want to make sure that we do everything we can to promote it effectively.

I'm thinking that we could do a cross-promotion with another game developer, like Nintendium. They have a similar target audience to us, and I think it would be a great way to reach new players.

I've already reached out to Nintendium, and they're interested in the idea. I'm just waiting on a few details from them before we can finalize the details.

I'll keep you updated on the progress, and I'll let you know as soon as we have something concrete to share.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Hector
