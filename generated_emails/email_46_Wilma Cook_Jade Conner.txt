Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming financial projections for the next quarter. I know you're busy, but I'd really appreciate it if you could take a look at them and let me know what you think. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the projected growth in our mobile gaming division.

I'm also hoping you can give me some advice on how to improve our marketing strategy. We've been seeing a lot of competition in the market lately, and I think we need to do something to stand out from the crowd.

I know you're a busy woman, but I really value your input. I'm hoping you can take a look at these things and get back to me as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Wilma
