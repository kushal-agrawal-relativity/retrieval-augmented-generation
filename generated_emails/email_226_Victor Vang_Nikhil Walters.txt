Hi Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of performance reviews. As you know, we're looking to get feedback from all levels of the company, so I'd like to schedule some time to chat with you about your thoughts on the team's performance over the past year.

I'd also like to get your input on our current performance management process. Are you happy with the way things are going, or do you have any suggestions for how we could improve?

I'm available to meet with you on Monday or Wednesday next week. Please let me know what works best for your schedule.

Thanks,
Victor
