Dear Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." As you know, I'm the lead account manager for this project, and I'm responsible for coordinating with all of our partners to ensure that the launch goes smoothly.

I'm reaching out to you because I'm concerned about the progress of the software development. We're just a few weeks away from the launch, and I'm not sure that the game is going to be ready in time.

I understand that you've been working hard on this project, and I appreciate all of your efforts. However, I'm worried that we're going to miss our deadline, and this could have serious consequences for the company.

I'm asking you to please do everything you can to get the game finished on time. I know that it's a lot to ask, but it's important that we meet this deadline.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Keenan
