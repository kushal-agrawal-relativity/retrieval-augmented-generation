Hey Hector,

I wanted to get your thoughts on the new marketing campaign we're working on. I think we're on the right track, but I wanted to see if you had any suggestions for how we could improve it.

Specifically, I'm thinking about the way we're targeting our audience. I think we could do a better job of reaching out to people who are actually interested in our games.

Do you have any ideas for how we could do that? I'm open to anything, so let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
