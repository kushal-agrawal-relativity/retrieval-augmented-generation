Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we get the marketing right.

I'm thinking that we should focus on creating a strong social media presence for the game. We can do this by creating engaging content, running contests, and interacting with our fans. I think this would be a great way to build excitement for the game and generate buzz.

I'd also like to suggest that we partner with some influencers to promote the game. This could be a great way to reach a wider audience and get people excited about Splatty McSplat.

I'm open to other ideas, so please let me know if you have any suggestions.

I'm looking forward to working with you on this project.

Best,
Hector
