Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of adding a new software engineer to our team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and our current team is starting to reach capacity. I think adding another engineer would help us to keep up with the demand for our products and services.

I've been doing some research, and I think I've found a few candidates who would be a good fit for our team. I'd like to set up some time to talk to you about them and get your feedback. Are you available for a meeting next week?

Thanks,
Ronan
