Dear Ronan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game. As you know, we're planning to release it on Steam on January 1st, and I wanted to get your thoughts on our marketing strategy.

I'm thinking that we should focus on promoting the game to our existing customers. We have a large email list of people who have purchased our games in the past, and I think we should send them a personalized email about the new game. We could also run some targeted ads on social media to reach people who are interested in games like ours.

What do you think? Do you have any other ideas for marketing the game? I'm open to suggestions.

Thanks,
Keenan
