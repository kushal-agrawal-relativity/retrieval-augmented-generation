Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming hiring event for software engineers. I'm on the hiring committee for this event, and I'm looking for your input on the ideal candidate profile.

What are the most important qualities you look for in a software engineer? What kind of experience do you think is most relevant to the work we do here at Spintendo Gizzard?

I'd also love to hear your thoughts on the interview process. What kind of questions do you think are most effective at assessing a candidate's skills and abilities?

Any feedback you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Ronan
