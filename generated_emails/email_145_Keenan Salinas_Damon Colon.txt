Dear Damon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we have the best possible marketing in place to ensure its success.

I've been thinking about the best way to approach this, and I think that we should focus on creating a campaign that is both visually appealing and engaging. We need to create something that will capture the attention of potential players and make them want to learn more about the game.

I think that we could achieve this by creating a series of short, animated videos that showcase the game's features and gameplay. These videos should be fun and lighthearted, and they should give players a taste of what the game is all about.

I've attached a few examples of animated videos that I think could serve as inspiration for our campaign. I'd love to hear your thoughts on these, and I'm also open to other ideas that you might have.

We need to get started on this campaign as soon as possible, so let's chat soon to discuss next steps.

Thanks,
Keenan
