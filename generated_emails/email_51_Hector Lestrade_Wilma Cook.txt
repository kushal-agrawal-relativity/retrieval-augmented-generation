Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McBlast. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I think we should focus on creating a buzz around the game by reaching out to influencers and streamers. We could send them early copies of the game and ask them to create content about it. We could also run some contests and giveaways on social media.

I'm also thinking about creating a landing page for the game where people can sign up for a newsletter and get early access to the beta. This would be a great way to build a list of potential customers and get them excited about the game.

I'm open to other ideas, so please let me know what you think. I'm really excited about this campaign, and I think it has the potential to be a huge success.

Thanks,
Hector
