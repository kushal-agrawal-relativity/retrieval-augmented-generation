Hey Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to see if you'd be interested in doing a guest blog post for our company's website. We're always looking for ways to get more exposure for our games, and we think your insights as a lead software engineer would be really valuable to our readers.

We're open to whatever topic you'd like to write about, but we'd love to hear your thoughts on the latest trends in game development, or any challenges you've faced in your career. We'd also be happy to provide you with some talking points or questions to help you get started.

If you're interested, please let me know and I can send you more details. We'd love to have you on board!

Thanks,
Hector
