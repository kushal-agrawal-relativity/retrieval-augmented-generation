Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." I'm concerned that we're not doing enough to promote the game, and I think we're going to miss out on a lot of sales if we don't do something more.

I've been doing some research, and I've found that our competitors are spending a lot of money on advertising their new games. They're running ads on TV, online, and in print. They're also using social media to reach their target audience.

I think we need to do the same thing if we want to compete. We need to make sure that people know about our game, and we need to make sure that they're excited about it.

I'm not sure what the best way to do this is, but I think we need to start brainstorming some ideas. I'm open to any suggestions you have.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
