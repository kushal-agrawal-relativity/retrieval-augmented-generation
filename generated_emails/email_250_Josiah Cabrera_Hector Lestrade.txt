Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm thinking that we should do a social media blitz, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We could create some fun, engaging content that would appeal to our target audience of young gamers.

I've attached a few ideas for posts that we could share. Let me know what you think, and we can start working on a plan.

Thanks,
Josiah
