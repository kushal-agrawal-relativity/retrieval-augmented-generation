Hey Hector,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your feedback before I move forward.

I'm thinking that we should focus on creating a sense of excitement and anticipation for the game. We could do this by releasing teaser trailers, running contests, and collaborating with influencers. I also think it would be a good idea to create a dedicated landing page for the game, where people can sign up for updates and learn more about it.

What do you think? Do you have any other ideas that we could incorporate into the campaign? I'm open to suggestions.

Let me know what you think, and I can send you the full marketing plan later this week.

Thanks,
Josiah
