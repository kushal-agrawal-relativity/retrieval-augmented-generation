Hey Scarlett,

I just wanted to touch base and see how things are going with the new game design. I know you've been working hard on it, and I'm excited to see what you come up with.

I'm also curious to hear what your thoughts are on the new marketing campaign. I think it's a great idea, but I'd love to get your feedback on how we can make it even better.

Let me know if you have any time this week to chat. I'm free on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning.

Thanks,
Hector
