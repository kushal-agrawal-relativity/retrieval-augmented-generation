Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Quest." I'm excited to report that we're on track for a Q4 launch, and I think we're going to have a real hit on our hands.

I've attached a progress report that outlines our current status. As you can see, we've been making great progress on all fronts. The development team is on schedule, the art is looking fantastic, and the marketing campaign is already generating a lot of buzz.

I'm confident that Splatty's Quest is going to be a huge success. It's a fun, engaging game that I think will appeal to a wide range of players. I'm also confident that our marketing campaign will help us reach a large audience.

I'm looking forward to working with you to launch Splatty's Quest and make it a success.

Best,
Scarlett
