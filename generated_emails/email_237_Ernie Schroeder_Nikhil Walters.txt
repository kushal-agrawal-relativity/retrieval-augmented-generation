Dear Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty McBlotch." As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the new multiplayer mode that we've been working on. This is a really innovative feature, and I think it's going to be a big hit with players.

I'm also really happy with the way the game is looking. The art team has done a fantastic job, and the game is really coming together.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the game and let me know what you think. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the multiplayer mode.

I'm available to meet with you at your convenience. Just let me know when you're free.

Thanks,
Ernie
