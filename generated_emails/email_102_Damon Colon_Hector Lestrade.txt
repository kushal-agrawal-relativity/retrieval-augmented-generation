Hey Hector,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplatface. I've been working on some concept art and I think I have a few ideas that could really help to capture the attention of our target audience.

I'm thinking we could do something really fun and interactive, like a social media contest or a live stream event. I'm also open to hearing your thoughts on the matter.

Let me know what you think and we can chat more about it at our next team meeting.

Thanks,
Damon
