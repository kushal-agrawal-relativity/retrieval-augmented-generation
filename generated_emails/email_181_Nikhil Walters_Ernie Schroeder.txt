Hey Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the new game engine we're developing. I wanted to get your thoughts on the current progress and see if you have any suggestions for how we can improve it.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep it brief. We're making good progress on the engine, but I think we could do a better job of making it modular. This would make it easier to add new features and to maintain the code.

I'm also concerned about the performance of the engine. We're using a lot of high-level abstractions, which is making it difficult to optimize. I think we need to find a way to reduce the number of abstractions without sacrificing the readability of the code.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these issues. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Nikhil
