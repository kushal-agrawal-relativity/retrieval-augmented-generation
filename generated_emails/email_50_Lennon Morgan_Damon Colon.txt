Hi Damon,

I'm Lennon, the network admin here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out because I'm having some trouble with the new art assets that were uploaded to the server yesterday. The files are all corrupted, and I can't seem to get them to load properly.

I'm wondering if you could take a look at them and see if you can figure out what's going on. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the files themselves or if there's something wrong with the server.

Let me know if you need anything from me. I'm available all day to help troubleshoot this.

Thanks,
Lennon
