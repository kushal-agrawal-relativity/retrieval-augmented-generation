Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild." As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm reaching out to you because I'd like to get your input on the marketing campaign. I think your expertise in game design would be invaluable in helping us create a campaign that will resonate with our target audience.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can best use social media to promote the game. I think this is a great opportunity to reach out to new players and generate excitement for the release.

I'd love to set up a time to chat with you about this. Are you available for a meeting next week?

Thanks,
Jade
