Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming account manager performance reviews. As you know, these reviews are a critical opportunity for us to assess the performance of our account managers and provide them with feedback on how they can improve.

I'd like to schedule a time to meet with you to discuss your performance review. I'm available on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from 10am to 2pm. Please let me know what time works best for you.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Victor
