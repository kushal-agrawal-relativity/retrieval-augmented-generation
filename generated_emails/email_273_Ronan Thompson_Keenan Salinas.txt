Hey Keenan,

I'm writing to you about the new account management software that we're looking to implement. I've been doing some research and I think that [software name] would be a good fit for our needs.

[Software name] is a cloud-based software that allows account managers to track and manage customer accounts, create and send proposals, and track sales. It also has a built-in CRM system that would help us to keep track of our customer interactions.

I've attached a demo of the software so that you can take a look. I'd love to get your thoughts on it and see if you think it would be a good fit for our company.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ronan
