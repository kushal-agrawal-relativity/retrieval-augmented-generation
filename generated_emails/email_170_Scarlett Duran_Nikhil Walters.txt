Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the new game design prototype I've been working on. I'm really excited about it, and I think it has the potential to be a big hit.

I've attached the prototype to this email, so you can take a look at it. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it, and I'm also open to any feedback you have.

I'm hoping to get started on development as soon as possible, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Scarlett
