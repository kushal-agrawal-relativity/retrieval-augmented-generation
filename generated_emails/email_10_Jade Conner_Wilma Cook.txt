Hi Wilma,

I wanted to touch base with you about the upcoming financial projections for Q4. I'm seeing some concerning trends in our spending, and I wanted to run them by you before we finalize the budget.

Specifically, I'm worried about our spending on marketing and sales. It seems like we're overspending on advertising, and our sales team isn't bringing in enough revenue to justify the cost.

I'd like to propose a few changes to the budget that I think will help us save money without sacrificing our growth. I'll send you a more detailed proposal later this week, but I wanted to get your thoughts on the idea in general.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jade
