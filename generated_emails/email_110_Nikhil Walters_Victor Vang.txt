Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of expanding our internship program. As you know, we've had a great success with our interns in the past, and I think it's a great way to get new talent into the company.

I'm thinking that we could expand the program to include more students from different backgrounds and disciplines. This would help us to diversify our workforce and bring in new ideas.

I've attached a proposal that outlines my ideas for expanding the program. I'd love to get your thoughts on it and discuss it further.

Let me know if you're free to chat sometime this week.

Thanks,
Nikhil
