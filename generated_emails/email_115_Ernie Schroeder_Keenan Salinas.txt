Hi Keenan,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any availability this week to chat about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I'd love to get your input on the creative direction and make sure we're on the same page.

I'm available on Monday at 10am, Wednesday at 2pm, and Friday at 4pm. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Ernie
