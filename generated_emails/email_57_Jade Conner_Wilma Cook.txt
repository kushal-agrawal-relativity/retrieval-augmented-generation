Hi Wilma,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming financial projections for the next quarter. As you know, we're facing some challenges due to the recent economic downturn. However, I'm confident that we can weather this storm and come out stronger on the other side.

I've been working on some revised projections that take into account the current economic climate. I believe that these projections are more realistic and will help us to make informed decisions about our spending and investments.

I'd like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss these projections in more detail. I'm available on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday at your convenience.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jade
