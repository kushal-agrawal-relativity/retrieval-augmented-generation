Hi Jade,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." I've been working on the product roadmap for this game, and I wanted to get your input on a few things.

First, I'm thinking that we should release the game on all major platforms at the same time. This would give us the best chance of reaching a wide audience and generating sales. What do you think about that?

Second, I'm considering offering a pre-order bonus for the game. This could be something like a special skin for Splatty, or a bonus level. Do you think this would be a good idea?

Finally, I'm wondering if we should do a marketing campaign for the game. This could include things like advertising, social media, and PR. What do you think about the best way to market this game?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these things. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ernie
