Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big release for us, and we're all really excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the new software engineering features that you've implemented. I think they're going to make the game a lot more fun and engaging for players.

I'm also really impressed with the way you've worked with the other team members to get this project done on time and on budget. It's clear that you're a valuable asset to our team, and I'm grateful for your hard work.

I know you're probably busy, but I would love to get your thoughts on a few things before we launch the game. Can you make some time for a chat this week?

Thanks,
Jade
