Hi Jade,

I'm Damon Colon, the Head of Art here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out to you because I'm concerned about the budget for our upcoming project. I've been working with Ronan and Scarlett, and we're all in agreement that the budget is too tight to deliver the quality of art that we want.

I know that you're the CFO, and you have to make tough decisions about budgets. But I'm asking you to please reconsider this one. The art is the most important part of any game, and we're not going to be able to make a great game if we don't have the resources to do it right.

I'm open to discussing this further with you, and I'm happy to provide any more information that you need. Thanks for your time.

Damon
