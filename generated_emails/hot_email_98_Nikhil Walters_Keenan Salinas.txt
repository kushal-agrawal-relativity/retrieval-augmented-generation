Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent issue with the new game engine. As you know, we've been having some problems with it crashing, and I think I've finally found the cause.

It turns out that the engine was using a lot of memory that it didn't need to, which was causing it to crash. I've been able to fix this issue, but I need your help to roll out the fix to all of our users.

Can you please send me a list of all of the users who have downloaded the new game engine? I need to make sure that they all get the update.

Also, I need you to keep this fix a secret. We don't want anyone to know that we had a problem with the engine, or they might lose confidence in our company.

Thanks for your help,
Nikhil

P.S. I know we're supposed to keep this a secret, but I just wanted to let you know that I'm really proud of you for finding the fix to the engine problem. You did a great job!
