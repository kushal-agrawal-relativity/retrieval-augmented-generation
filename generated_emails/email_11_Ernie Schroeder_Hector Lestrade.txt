Hey Hector,

I just wanted to touch base with you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game. I'm thinking we should focus on social media and paid advertising. What do you think?

I also wanted to get your thoughts on the launch event. I'm thinking we should do something big and flashy, like a live stream event or a product giveaway.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
