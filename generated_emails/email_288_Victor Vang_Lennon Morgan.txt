Hi Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent security breach that we experienced. As you know, our network was compromised by a third-party actor, and a number of our employees' personal information was leaked.

I'm reaching out to you specifically because your role as Network Administrator is critical to the security of our company's data. I'm concerned that the breach may have been caused by a vulnerability in our network infrastructure, and I'd like to ask you to conduct a full security audit of our systems.

I understand that this is a lot to ask, but it's important that we take every possible step to protect our employees' data. I'm confident that you're up to the task, and I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Victor
