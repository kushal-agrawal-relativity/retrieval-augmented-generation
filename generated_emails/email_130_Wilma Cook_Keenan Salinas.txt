Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a major project for our company, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure its success.

One of the things that we need to focus on is our account management strategy. We need to make sure that we're reaching out to the right people and that we're providing them with the information they need to make a decision to buy our game.

I'm confident that you're the right person to lead this effort. You have a proven track record of success in account management, and I know that you're passionate about this project.

I'm looking forward to working with you on this. Let's set up a time to chat next week so we can discuss our plans in more detail.

Best,
Wilma
