Hi Jade,

I'm reaching out to you about the new product roadmap. I've been working on some ideas for a new game that I think would be a great addition to our portfolio. I'd love to get your thoughts on it and see if you think it's something we should pursue.

I'm thinking of a 2D platformer with a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving. The art style would be inspired by classic Nintendo games, and the gameplay would be similar to titles like Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

I've attached a few concept sketches and a short gameplay demo. I'd love to hear your feedback on what you think, and if you have any ideas for how we could improve the game.

Let me know if you're free to chat sometime this week. I'm available on Tuesday and Wednesday after 3pm.

Thanks,
Ernie
