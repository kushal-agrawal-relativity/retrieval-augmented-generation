Hi Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in network downtime. As you know, this has been a major issue for our customers and has resulted in a number of complaints.

I'm concerned that the current network infrastructure is not scalable enough to meet the demands of our growing business. I'm also concerned that our current team of network administrators is not adequately equipped to handle the increased load.

I would like to propose that we invest in a new network infrastructure and hire a team of experienced network administrators. I believe that this would help to resolve the issue of network downtime and improve the overall customer experience.

I'm available to discuss this further with you at your convenience. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Keenan
