Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we get the word out there in a big way.

I've been thinking about a few different ways to approach this, and I think that the best way to reach our target audience is through social media. We can create a buzz around the game by releasing trailers and gameplay videos on YouTube, and by running contests and giveaways on Twitter and Instagram.

I'm also thinking about reaching out to some gaming influencers to see if they'd be interested in playing Splatty McSplat and giving us their feedback. This could be a great way to get some early exposure for the game and to build excitement among our target audience.

I'm still working out the details, but I wanted to get your thoughts on this so far. Do you have any ideas that you'd like to share?

Thanks,
Hector
