Hi Jade,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming hiring round for our new game development team. As you know, we're looking to add a few new members to the team, and I wanted to get your thoughts on the process.

I've already put together a list of potential candidates, but I'd love to hear your feedback before we move forward. Do you have any particular candidates in mind that you think would be a good fit for our team? Or, do you have any suggestions for how we can improve our hiring process?

Any input you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Victor
