Dear Nikhil,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty the Splatfish." As you know, this is our most ambitious project to date, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the new physics engine that you've developed for the game. It's going to allow us to create some really amazing gameplay experiences that our fans are going to love.

I know that you've been working hard on this project, and I want to thank you for your dedication. I'm confident that you're going to deliver a great product, and I'm looking forward to seeing it launch.

In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
Wilma
