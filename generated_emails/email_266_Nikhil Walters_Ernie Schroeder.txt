Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I wanted to get your thoughts on the marketing plan for the game. I think we have a good start, but I'd like to get your input before we finalize it.

Specifically, I'm wondering if you think we're doing enough to reach out to potential players who are outside of our core demographic. We've traditionally focused on marketing to gamers who are already familiar with our brand, but I think we could reach a wider audience if we tried to appeal to a broader range of interests.

What do you think? Do you have any suggestions for how we can reach out to new audiences?

I'm also open to any other feedback you have on the marketing plan.

Thanks,
Nikhil
