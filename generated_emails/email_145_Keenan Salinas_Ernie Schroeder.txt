Hi Ernie,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, "Splatty McSplat." As you know, this is a big project for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm reaching out to you because I'm concerned about the marketing plan for the game. I think we need to do a better job of reaching out to our target audience. I'm worried that if we don't, the game won't be as successful as it could be.

I'd like to suggest that we create a more targeted marketing campaign. We could focus on specific demographics, such as gamers who are interested in action games. We could also create more engaging marketing materials, such as videos and trailers.

I think these changes would help us to reach a wider audience and generate more excitement for the game. I'm confident that this would lead to a more successful launch.

I'm happy to discuss this further with you. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Keenan
