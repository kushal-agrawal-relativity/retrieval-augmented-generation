Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." I'm excited to report that we're on track for a Q4 release, and I'm confident that the game is going to be a huge success.

I've attached a progress report that outlines our current status. As you can see, we've made significant progress in the past few months. We've completed all of the major gameplay features, and we're currently in the process of polishing the game and adding the finishing touches.

I'm particularly proud of the work that our team has done on the game's graphics. Splatty's Adventure is going to be the most visually stunning game that we've ever released. I'm also confident that the gameplay is going to be incredibly fun and addictive.

I'm looking forward to getting your feedback on the progress report. As always, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Nikhil
