Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm hoping you can give me some advice on how to best reach our target audience.

We're targeting gamers between the ages of 18 and 30. They're typically tech-savvy and social media-savvy. We want to create a campaign that will get them excited about the game and encourage them to pre-order it.

I've been thinking about doing a social media campaign, but I'm not sure what the best approach would be. I'm also considering doing some paid advertising, but I'm not sure what platforms would be most effective.

Do you have any thoughts on this? I'd love to hear your suggestions.

Thanks,
Keenan
