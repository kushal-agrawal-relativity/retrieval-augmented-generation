Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the progress of the new game engine. As you know, we're on track to meet our deadline, but I wanted to get your thoughts on a few things.

First, I'm wondering if we should add support for VR. I know it's a hot topic right now, and I think it could be a great way to differentiate our game from the competition. However, it would also add a lot of complexity to the development process, so I wanted to get your input before we make a decision.

Second, I'm thinking about adding a new physics engine. The current one is fine, but I think it could be improved. I've been looking at a few different options, and I'm leaning towards using the PhysX engine from Nvidia. Do you have any thoughts on this?

Finally, I wanted to get your feedback on the overall design of the game engine. Do you think it's meeting your expectations? Are there any areas that you think could be improved?

I'm open to any suggestions you have. We're still in the early stages of development, so there's plenty of time to make changes.

Thanks,
Ronan
