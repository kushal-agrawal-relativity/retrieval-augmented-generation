Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. As you know, this is a critical campaign for the success of the game, so I wanted to get your input on how we can best reach our target audience.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can use social media to our advantage. Do you think we should focus on paid advertising, or should we try to generate organic traffic through user-generated content?

I'm also open to any other ideas you have for the campaign. We have a budget of \$100,000, so we have some flexibility in terms of what we can do.

I'd love to chat with you about this more at our next team meeting. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions you have.

Thanks,
Ernie
