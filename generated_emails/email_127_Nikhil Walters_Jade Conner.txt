Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty McSplatface." I'm excited to announce that we're planning to launch a new marketing campaign to coincide with the release.

I've been working with our marketing team to come up with a plan, and I think we've got something really special. We're going to be using a combination of social media, email marketing, and paid advertising to reach our target audience.

I'm confident that this campaign will be a success, and I'm looking forward to seeing the results.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Nikhil
