Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild." As you know, this is our most ambitious game yet, and we're all incredibly excited about it.

I wanted to get your thoughts on the marketing campaign for the game. We're planning to launch a big ad campaign on TV, radio, and online, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to reach our target audience.

I think we should also focus on social media and word-of-mouth marketing. What do you think? Do you have any ideas for how we can reach more people and get them excited about the game?

Let me know what you think. I'm open to any suggestions.

Thanks,
Wilma
