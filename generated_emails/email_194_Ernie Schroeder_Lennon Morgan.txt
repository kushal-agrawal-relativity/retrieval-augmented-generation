Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent network outages we've been experiencing. As you know, these outages have been causing a lot of problems for our developers and QA testers, and it's important that we get them resolved as soon as possible.

I've been looking into the issue, and I think it's likely that the problem is with our DNS servers. I've already started working on a fix, but I wanted to get your input as well. Do you have any thoughts on what might be causing the problem? And do you have any suggestions for how to fix it?

I'm hoping we can get this resolved quickly so that our developers can get back to work. Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
