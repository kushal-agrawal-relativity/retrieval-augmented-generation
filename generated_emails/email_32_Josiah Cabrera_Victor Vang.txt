Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splatty McSplatface." I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we should focus on social media marketing. We could create a dedicated hashtag for the game, and run contests and giveaways on Twitter and Instagram. We could also partner with influencers to promote the game.

I'm also considering doing some paid advertising. We could run ads on Facebook and Google, or we could buy sponsored posts from influencers.

I'm still in the early stages of planning, but I wanted to get your thoughts on my ideas. What do you think? Do you have any other suggestions?

I'm available to chat anytime this week. Just let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Josiah
