Hi Scarlett,

Hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you about the new game design initiative. I'm really excited about the potential of this project, and I think it could be a real game-changer for our company.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the new character design. I think you've done a great job of creating a unique and memorable character that appeals to our target audience.

I'd love to get your feedback on a few ideas I have for the game's story. I think it could be really powerful if we could create a narrative that really resonates with players.

I'm also interested in your thoughts on the game's overall mechanics. I think it's important that we create a game that's both challenging and fun to play.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at my ideas and let me know what you think. I'm available to chat anytime this week.

Thanks,
Ernie
