Hi Ernie,

I wanted to get your thoughts on the new marketing campaign we're working on. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the target audience and the overall messaging.

I think we have a great opportunity to reach a wider audience with this campaign, but I want to make sure we're doing it in a way that's authentic to our brand.

Can you take a look at the campaign materials and let me know what you think? I'd love to get your feedback before we move forward.

Thanks,
Josiah
