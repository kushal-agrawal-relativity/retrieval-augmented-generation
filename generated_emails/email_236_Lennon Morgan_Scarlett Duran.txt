Hi Scarlett,

I'm Lennon, the Network Administrator here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out to you because I'm having some trouble with the new game design software that you just installed on our servers.

When I try to access the software, I get an error message that says "The software cannot be found." I've tried restarting my computer and reinstalling the software, but the problem persists.

I'm not sure if this is a problem with the software itself or with our servers, so I wanted to reach out to you to see if you have any ideas.

Thanks,
Lennon
