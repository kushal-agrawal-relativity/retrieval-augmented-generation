Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm concerned that we're not going to meet our sales goals, and I wanted to see if you had any ideas on how we can improve our marketing strategy.

I know that you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the attached sales projections and let me know what you think. We're already running a few ads on social media, but I'm not sure if we're reaching the right audience.

I'm also open to any other suggestions you might have. We need to do something to increase sales, or this game is going to be a flop.

Thanks,
Jade
