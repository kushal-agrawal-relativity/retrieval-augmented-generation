Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the work you've done on the product management side. You've really nailed the balance between making the game accessible to new players while still offering a challenge for experienced gamers.

I'm confident that Splatty McSplat is going to be a huge success, and I want to thank you for all your hard work on it.

I'm looking forward to working with you on future projects.

Best,
Wilma
