Hey Lennon,

I'm reaching out because I'm having some trouble with the new network setup. I'm not sure if it's a configuration issue or if something is wrong with the hardware, but I can't seem to get connected to the VPN.

Could you take a look at it for me? I'm available all day today if you want to come by my office or hop on a call.

Thanks,
Ernie
