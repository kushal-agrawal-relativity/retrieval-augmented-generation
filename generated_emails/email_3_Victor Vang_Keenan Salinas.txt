Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent account manager performance reviews. As you know, we've been seeing some decline in our account manager retention rate, and I'm concerned that this could have a negative impact on our bottom line.

I'd like to work with you to develop a plan to improve our account manager retention rate. I think it's important that we focus on providing our account managers with the support and resources they need to be successful.

I'm also open to hearing your ideas on how we can improve our account manager retention rate.

Can we set up a time to chat this week?

Thanks,
Victor
