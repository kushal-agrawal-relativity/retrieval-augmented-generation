Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty's Adventure. As you know, this is our biggest game yet, and we're expecting a lot of demand from players.

I'm concerned that we might not have enough servers to handle the load, so I'm asking you to work with our network team to make sure we're prepared. I know you're busy, but this is a critical issue, so I'd appreciate it if you could give it your full attention.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Nikhil
