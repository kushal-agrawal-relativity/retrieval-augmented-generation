Hi Wilma,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of layoffs. As you know, we've been facing some tough financial challenges lately, and we've had to make some difficult decisions about our workforce.

I know that this is a difficult time for everyone involved, and I want to thank you for your understanding and support. I'm confident that we'll get through this together.

I've attached a list of the employees who will be affected by the layoffs. I've also included a severance package that we're providing to all of the affected employees.

I'll be holding a meeting with all of the affected employees on Monday morning at 10am. I'll be there to answer any questions that you may have.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks,
Victor
