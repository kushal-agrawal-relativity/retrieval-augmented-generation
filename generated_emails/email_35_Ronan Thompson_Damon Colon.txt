Hey Damon,

I'm writing to you about the new character models for the upcoming game. I think we need to make some changes to the way they're animated. The movements feel a bit stiff and unnatural, and I think it's taking away from the overall immersion of the game.

I'm not sure if you're aware, but we've been getting a lot of feedback from players about the character animations. They're saying that they feel like they're controlling robots, rather than real people.

I think we need to take a look at the way we're animating the characters and see if we can make some improvements. I'm open to suggestions, so let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ronan
