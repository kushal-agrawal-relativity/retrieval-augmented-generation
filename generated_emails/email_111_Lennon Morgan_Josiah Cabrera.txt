Hi Josiah,

I'm Lennon, the Network Administrator here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in DDoS attacks on our servers.

As you know, DDoS attacks are a serious threat to our business. They can disrupt our services, damage our reputation, and cost us money.

I've been working with our security team to investigate the attacks and develop a plan to mitigate them. We've already implemented a number of security measures, but we're still seeing attacks.

I'm concerned that the attacks are getting worse, and I'm worried about the impact they could have on our business.

I'd like to meet with you to discuss the attacks and our plans to mitigate them. I think it's important that we work together to address this issue.

Can you meet with me tomorrow at 10am in my office?

Thanks,
Lennon
