Hi Ernie,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splodey Bob." As you know, this is a big project for us, and I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

I'm reaching out to you because I'd like to get your input on the marketing plan for the game. I think it's important that we have a strong marketing campaign in place to help us reach our target audience.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can best use social media to promote the game. I think this is a great opportunity to connect with our fans and build excitement for the release.

I'd also like to hear your thoughts on how we can best reach out to influencers. I think this is a great way to get the word out about the game and generate some buzz.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the marketing plan and let me know your thoughts. I'm available to chat anytime this week if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Nikhil
