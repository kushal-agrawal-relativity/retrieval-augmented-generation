Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the progress of the new game we're working on. I'm happy to report that we're on track to meet our deadlines, and I'm confident that the game will be a success.

I've attached a progress report that outlines our progress so far. As you can see, we've completed all of the major milestones, and we're currently in the process of polishing the game and adding the finishing touches.

I'd like to thank you for your support on this project. Your guidance and feedback have been invaluable.

I'm looking forward to sharing the game with you soon.

Best,
Scarlett
