Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you about the new level design for the upcoming game. I have a few ideas that I think would really improve the gameplay, and I'd love to get your thoughts on them.

I'm thinking of adding a new section where the player has to navigate a series of platforms that are constantly moving. This would add a new level of challenge and excitement, and it would also force the player to think more strategically about how they're moving through the level.

I'm also considering adding a new enemy type that's more difficult to defeat than the enemies that are already in the game. This would make the game more challenging, and it would also give the player a sense of accomplishment when they finally defeat the enemy.

I'm still working on these ideas, but I think they have the potential to make the game a lot more fun. I'd love to hear your thoughts on them, and I'm also open to any other suggestions you might have.

Let me know what you think!

Best,
Scarlett
