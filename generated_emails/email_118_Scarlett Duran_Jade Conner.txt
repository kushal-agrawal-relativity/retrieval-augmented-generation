Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2." As you know, this is a major release for our company, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the new game engine that we're using for this project. It's a very powerful engine that will allow us to create some really amazing visuals. I think that this is going to be the best Zelda game yet.

I'm also working on a new character for the game. Her name is Linkle, and she's a female version of Link. I think that she's going to be a really popular character with our fans.

I'm still working on the story, but I think that it's going to be really engaging. It's going to be a dark and mysterious story, but it's also going to be hopeful.

I'm really looking forward to sharing more details about the game with you soon. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks,
Scarlett
