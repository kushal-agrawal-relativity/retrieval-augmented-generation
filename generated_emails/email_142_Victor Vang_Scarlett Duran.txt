Hi Scarlett,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of performance reviews. As you know, we're looking to get feedback from all levels of the company, so I'd appreciate it if you could take some time to provide your thoughts on your team's performance over the past year.

I know you're busy, but any feedback you can provide would be really helpful. We're looking to make sure that we're setting our team up for success in the future, and your input is essential to that process.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Victor
