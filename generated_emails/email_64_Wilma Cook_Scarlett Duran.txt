Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty the Splatfish." As you know, this is a major project for our company, and I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

I'm particularly excited about the work that you've done on the game's design. You've really captured the essence of what makes a great game, and I think that players are going to love it.

I wanted to reach out and thank you for all of your hard work on this project. You've been a valuable asset to our team, and I'm grateful for your contributions.

I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product, and I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

Best,
Wilma
