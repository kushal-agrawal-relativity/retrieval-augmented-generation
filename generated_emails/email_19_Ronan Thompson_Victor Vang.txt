Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of hiring a new software engineer. As you know, our team has been growing rapidly over the past few months, and we're starting to reach a point where we need to add some more people to the mix.

I've been doing some research, and I think I've found a few candidates who would be a good fit for our team. I'd like to set up some time to talk to you about them and get your thoughts on whether or not they'd be a good addition to Spintendo Gizzard.

Are you free for a chat sometime this week?

Thanks,
Ronan
