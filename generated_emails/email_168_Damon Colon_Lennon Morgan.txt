Hey Lennon,

I'm writing to you about the new art assets for the upcoming game. I've got a few notes that I wanted to run you by before we move forward.

First, I think the character design is really strong. The characters are visually appealing and have a lot of personality. I would love to see more of that in the environmental art. The environments feel a little flat and lifeless compared to the characters. I think adding some more detail and variation would help to bring them to life.

Second, I'm not sure about the color palette. The colors are all very bright and saturated, which can be a bit overwhelming. I would suggest toning them down a bit and using more muted colors. This will help to create a more cohesive look and feel for the game.

Finally, I think the overall composition of the art assets could be improved. The images are a bit cluttered and it's hard to focus on the important elements. I would suggest simplifying the compositions and making sure that the focus is on the most important parts of the image.

I hope these notes are helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Damon
