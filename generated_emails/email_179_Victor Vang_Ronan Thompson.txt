Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of performance reviews. As you know, we're conducting these reviews in order to assess the performance of our employees and identify areas where they can improve.

I've been reviewing your performance over the past few months, and I'm pleased to say that I'm very impressed with your work. You've consistently met or exceeded expectations, and you've been a valuable asset to the team.

I'm particularly impressed with your work on the new game engine. You've done a great job of leading the team and developing a product that is both innovative and user-friendly.

I'm also very impressed with your commitment to the company. You're always willing to go the extra mile, and you're always looking for ways to improve your work.

Overall, I'm very pleased with your performance. You're a valuable asset to the team, and I'm confident that you'll continue to be successful in the future.

I'd like to schedule a time to meet with you to discuss your performance in more detail. I'm available next week on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Please let me know what time works best for you.

Thanks,
Victor
