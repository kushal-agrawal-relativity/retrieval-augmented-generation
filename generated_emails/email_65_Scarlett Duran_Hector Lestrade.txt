Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McBlot. I've been working on the game design for the past few months, and I'm really excited about how it's coming together. I think it has the potential to be a huge hit, but we need to make sure we have a strong marketing campaign to support it.

I've been doing some research on the target audience for Splatty McBlot, and I think we need to focus on reaching kids aged 8-12. This is the demographic that is most likely to be interested in the game, and they're also the ones who are most likely to be influenced by marketing campaigns.

I've come up with a few ideas for marketing campaigns that I think would be effective in reaching this target audience. I've attached a document with more details about these ideas. I'd love to get your thoughts on them, and I'm also open to other ideas that you might have.

We need to start planning this campaign soon, so let's chat soon to discuss it further.

Thanks,
Scarlett
