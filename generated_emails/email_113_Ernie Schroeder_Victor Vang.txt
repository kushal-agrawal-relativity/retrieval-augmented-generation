Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatalot. As you know, this is a big project for us, and I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

I'm reaching out because I'm concerned about the current headcount for the project. We're currently at 100 people, and I think we need to add a few more to make sure that we can hit our deadlines.

I've already talked to Ronan and Scarlett, and they agree that we need to add some more people. I'm hoping that you can help us out with this.

I know that we're already over budget, but I think that the extra people will be worth it in the long run. We need to make sure that Splatalot is a success, and I think that this is the best way to do it.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
