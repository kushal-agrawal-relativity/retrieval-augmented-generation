Hey Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplatface. I'm thinking we should do a big social media push, and I was wondering if you could put together a list of influencers who would be a good fit for the game.

I'm also thinking we should do a contest on TikTok, where people can submit videos of themselves playing the game. The winner could get a free copy of the game, and their video would be featured on our social media channels.

Let me know what you think. I'm happy to brainstorm with you on this.

Thanks,
Ernie
