Hi Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I think we should focus on creating a buzz around the game before it's released. We could do this by releasing teaser trailers, creating social media content, and reaching out to influencers.

I've also been thinking about ways to make the game more appealing to a wider audience. I think we could add some new features, such as a multiplayer mode or a co-op mode.

I'm open to any suggestions you have. I think we can create something really special with this game, and I'm excited to work with you on it.

Let me know what you think.

Best,
Hector
