Hey Hector,

I'm reaching out to see if you'd be interested in collaborating on a marketing campaign for our upcoming game release. I think your expertise in public relations would be a valuable asset to the team, and I think it would be a great opportunity to get some cross-departmental collaboration going.

I've attached a brief overview of the game and the campaign we're planning, and I'd love to hear your thoughts. If you're interested, we can set up a time to chat more about it.

Thanks,
Josiah
