Hey Scarlett,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any time this week to chat about the new level design for the upcoming game. I've got a few ideas that I'd like to run by you and get your feedback on.

I'm free on Tuesday and Wednesday after 3pm, or Thursday morning. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Ronan
