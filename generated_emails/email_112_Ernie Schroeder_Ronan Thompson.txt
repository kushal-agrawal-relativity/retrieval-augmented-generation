Hi Ronan,

I'm reaching out to you today to discuss the progress on the new game engine. I'm excited to see how things are coming along, and I wanted to see if you had any updates to share.

I know you're busy, but I'd love to chat sometime this week if you have a few minutes. Ping me on Slack and we can set something up.

Thanks,
Ernie
