Hi Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in network downtime. As you know, this has been a major issue for our customers, and it's something that we need to address immediately.

I've asked our IT team to investigate the issue, and they're currently working on a fix. In the meantime, I'd like you to take a look at our network security measures and see if there's anything we can do to improve them.

I know that you're busy, but I'd appreciate it if you could get back to me with your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Wilma
