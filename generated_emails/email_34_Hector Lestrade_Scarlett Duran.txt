Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that highlight the game's unique features. I think this would be a great way to generate interest and excitement among potential players.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer to promote the game. This could be a great way to reach a wider audience.

I'm also considering running a contest or giveaway to generate buzz around the game. This could be a fun way to get people excited and talking about Splatty McSplat.

I'm open to any other ideas you might have. I think it's important to come up with a campaign that's creative and engaging, and that will appeal to our target audience.

I'm available to chat anytime this week if you'd like to brainstorm some more ideas. Just let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Hector
