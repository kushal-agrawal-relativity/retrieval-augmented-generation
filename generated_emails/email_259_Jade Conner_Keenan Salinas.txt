Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming sales projections for the new game we're releasing. As you know, this is a critical time for us, and we need to make sure that we're on track to meet our sales goals.

I've attached a copy of the sales projections for your review. I'd like you to take a look at them and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

I'm also going to need you to provide me with an update on the status of our sales team. How are we doing in terms of lead generation and conversion rates? Are we meeting our targets?

I need to have this information by the end of the week, so please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Jade
