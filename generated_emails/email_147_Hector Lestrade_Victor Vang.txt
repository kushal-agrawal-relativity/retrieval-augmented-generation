Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming PR campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback on them.

One idea is to create a series of short videos that highlight the different features of the game. We could also do some blog posts and social media posts to promote the game. I think it would be really helpful to get some influencers involved in the campaign as well.

I'm open to any suggestions you have, and I'm excited to work with you on this.

Let me know what you think!

Best,
Hector
