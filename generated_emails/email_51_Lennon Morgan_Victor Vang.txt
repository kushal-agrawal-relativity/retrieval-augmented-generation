Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in network outages. As you know, our network has been unstable for the past few weeks, and this has caused a number of problems for our employees.

I've been working with our team to troubleshoot the issue, and we believe that we've identified the source of the problem. We're currently working on a fix, and we expect to have the network back up and running by the end of the week.

In the meantime, I'm asking that you please be patient with our employees as they work through this issue. We appreciate your understanding.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Lennon
