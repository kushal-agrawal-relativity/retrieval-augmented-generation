Hi Ernie,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any availability this week to chat about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I'd love to get your input on the creative direction and make sure we're on the same page.

I'm free on Tuesday and Wednesday from 10am-2pm, and Thursday from 1pm-4pm. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Josiah
