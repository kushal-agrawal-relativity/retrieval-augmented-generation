Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild." As you know, this is a major release for our company, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the work that you've done on the game's design. You've created a truly immersive world that I think players are going to love exploring.

I wanted to reach out and thank you for all your hard work on this project. Your contributions have been invaluable, and I'm confident that the game will be a huge success.

I'm looking forward to working with you on future projects.

Best,
Ernie
