Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure its success.

One of the things that we need to do is make sure that we have a strong marketing campaign in place. I'm confident that you and your team are up to the task, but I wanted to reach out and offer my support in any way that I can.

If you have any ideas or suggestions for how we can improve our marketing campaign, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm always open to feedback.

In the meantime, I'm looking forward to seeing the results of your hard work. I know that Splatty McSplat is going to be a huge success, and I'm proud to be a part of it.

Best,
Nikhil
