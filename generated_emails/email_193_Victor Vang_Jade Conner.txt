Hi Jade,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming quarterly performance reviews. As you know, these reviews are an important opportunity for us to assess the performance of our employees and provide feedback on how they can improve.

I've attached a copy of the performance review form for your reference. I'd like you to take some time to review the form and think about how you would rate each of your direct reports. I'm also open to suggestions for any changes or additions to the form.

Once you've had a chance to review the form, please let me know if you have any questions. I'd also like to schedule a time to meet with you to discuss the reviews in more detail.

Thanks,
Victor
