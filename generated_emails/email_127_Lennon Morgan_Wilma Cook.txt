Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in network downtime. As you know, our network has been experiencing a number of outages over the past few weeks, which has caused a significant disruption to our employees and customers.

I've been working with our team to investigate the root cause of these outages, and we believe that we've identified the problem. We're currently working on a fix, and I'm confident that we'll be able to resolve this issue in the near future.

In the meantime, I'm asking for your help in communicating with our employees and customers about the recent outages. I've attached a brief statement that you can use to address these issues. I'd also appreciate it if you could share any questions or concerns that you or your team may have.

Thank you for your cooperation. I'll keep you updated on our progress.

Best regards,
Lennon
