Hey Lennon,

I'm Damon Colon, the Head of Art here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out because I'm having some trouble with our new graphics card drivers. I've tried everything I can think of, but I can't seem to get them to work properly.

I'm wondering if you could take a look at it for me? I'm not sure if it's a driver issue or a hardware issue, but I'm hoping you can help me narrow it down.

I'm available all day today if you want to come by my office. Otherwise, we can schedule a time to meet later this week.

Thanks for your help,
Damon
