Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty McBlotch." As you know, I'm the Head of Art here at Spintendo Gizzard, and I'm responsible for overseeing the development of all of our games' visual assets.

I'm reaching out because I'm concerned about the network performance of "Splatty McBlotch." I've been testing the game on a variety of different devices and networks, and I've noticed that there are some significant performance issues when playing the game online.

For example, when I'm playing the game on my phone over Wi-Fi, I experience frequent lag and stuttering. When I'm playing the game on my laptop over Ethernet, the performance is much better, but I still experience some occasional lag.

I'm concerned that these performance issues will negatively impact the player experience. I'm confident that we can fix these issues, but I need your help.

I'm asking you to run some performance tests on "Splatty McBlotch" and to identify the source of the performance issues. I'm also asking you to come up with a plan to fix these issues.

I know that you're busy, but I believe that this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. I'm confident that we can work together to fix these issues and deliver a great gaming experience to our players.

Thanks,
Damon
