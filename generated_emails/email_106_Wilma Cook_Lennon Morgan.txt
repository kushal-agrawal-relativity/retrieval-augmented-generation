Hi Lennon,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent network outages we've been experiencing. I know this has been a major inconvenience for our employees and customers, and I want to assure you that we're taking this very seriously.

We've already started working on a fix, and I'm confident that we'll have the issue resolved as soon as possible. In the meantime, I appreciate your patience and understanding.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks,
Wilma
