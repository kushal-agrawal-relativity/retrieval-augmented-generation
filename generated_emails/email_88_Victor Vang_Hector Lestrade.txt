Hi Hector,

I'm reaching out to you about the upcoming PR campaign for our new game, Splatty McBlots. I've been working with the marketing team to come up with a plan, and I wanted to get your input on the messaging.

We're thinking of focusing on the game's unique features, such as the ability to create your own levels and the cooperative multiplayer mode. We also want to emphasize the game's family-friendly appeal.

What do you think? Do you have any suggestions for how we can best market Splatty McBlots?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Victor
