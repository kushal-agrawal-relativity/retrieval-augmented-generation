Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I'm hoping you can give me some advice on how to reach our target audience.

We're aiming to market the game to kids aged 6-12. We think they'll be the most receptive to the game's fun and colorful graphics and challenging gameplay.

I'm not sure what the best way to reach this audience is. I've been thinking about doing some TV advertising, but I'm not sure if that's the best use of our budget. I've also considered doing some social media marketing, but I'm not sure how to reach kids on those platforms.

Do you have any ideas on how we can reach our target audience? I'm open to any suggestions.

Thanks,
Jade
