Hey Ronan,

I'm Lennon, the network admin here at Spintendo Gizzard. I just wanted to check in and see if you had any updates on the new server migration project. I know you're working on it with Scarlett, so I wanted to make sure we're all on the same page.

I'm available to help out in any way I can, so just let me know if you need anything.

Thanks,
Lennon
