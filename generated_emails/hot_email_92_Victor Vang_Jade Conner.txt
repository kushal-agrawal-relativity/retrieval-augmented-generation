Hi Jade,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent incident with Ronan Thompson. As you know, Ronan was caught downloading illegal software onto his work computer.

I've spoken to Ronan about this, and he's agreed to cooperate with us in our investigation. We've already deleted the illegal software from his computer, and we're in the process of tracking down the source of the download.

I know that this is a sensitive matter, and I want to assure you that we're taking it very seriously. We're committed to maintaining a safe and ethical workplace, and we will not tolerate any illegal activity.

I'm also writing to you because I know that you're close to Ronan. I want to ask you to please not discuss this matter with anyone outside of the company. We need to keep this confidential in order to protect the integrity of our investigation.

I know that you'll understand the importance of this. Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
Victor Vang
