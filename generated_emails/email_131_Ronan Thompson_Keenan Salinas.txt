Hey Keenan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty McBlot. As you know, we're planning to launch a big marketing campaign to coincide with the release, and I wanted to get your input on the creative direction.

I think it's important that we focus on the game's unique features and appeal to a wide range of players. I'm also interested in hearing your thoughts on how we can best reach our target audience.

Do you have any ideas for the campaign? I'm open to anything, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.

Thanks,
Ronan
