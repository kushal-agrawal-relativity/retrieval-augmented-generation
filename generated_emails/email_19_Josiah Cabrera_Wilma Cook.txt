Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I think we should focus on creating a sense of urgency and excitement around the game. We can do this by releasing teaser trailers and gameplay videos early, and by creating a buzz on social media. I also think we should partner with some influencers to get their attention.

I'm confident that this campaign will be a success. Splatty's Adventure is a great game, and I think people are going to love it. With the right marketing, we can make this game a huge hit.

Let me know what you think of my ideas. I'm happy to discuss them further with you.

Thanks,
Josiah
