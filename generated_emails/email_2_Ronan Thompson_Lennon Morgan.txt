Hey Lennon,

I'm writing to you about the recent network outages we've been experiencing. I've been looking into the issue, and I think it might be related to the new firewall that was installed last week. Can you take a look at the logs and see if you can spot anything that might be causing the problem?

I'm also wondering if we should consider rolling back the firewall to the previous version. I know that was a pain to set up, but it might be worth it if it means we can get the network back up and running smoothly.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ronan
