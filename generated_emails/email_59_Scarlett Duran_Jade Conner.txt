Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the new game design document that I'm working on. I wanted to get your feedback on it before I finalize it and send it to the rest of the team.

I've been working on this document for a few weeks now, and I think it's a pretty comprehensive overview of the game. I've included details on the story, the characters, the gameplay, and the level design.

I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the document and let me know what you think. Do you have any suggestions for improvements? Are there any areas that you think I could expand on?

I'm hoping to have the final document finished by the end of the week, so any feedback you can give me by then would be great.

Thanks,
Scarlett
