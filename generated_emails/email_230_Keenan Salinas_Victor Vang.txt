Hey Victor,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of adding a new account manager to our team.

As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and our current account managers are starting to get stretched thin. I think adding a new person to the team would help us to provide better service to our clients and grow our business even further.

I've already started looking for candidates, and I'm confident that I can find someone who is a good fit for our company culture and our team. I'm hoping to bring someone on board as soon as possible, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Keenan
