Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any availability this week to chat about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I'd love to get your input on the creative direction and see if you have any ideas for how we can best promote the game to our target audience.

I'm available on Monday and Wednesday from 10am-2pm, and Tuesday and Thursday from 3pm-6pm. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Josiah
