Hey Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McBlot. I'm thinking that we should focus on social media and influencer marketing, as this has been shown to be effective in reaching our target audience.

I've attached a few articles that you can read to learn more about these marketing channels. I'd also love to set up a time to chat with you about your thoughts on this strategy.

Let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Ernie
