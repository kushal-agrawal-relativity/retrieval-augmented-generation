Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short videos that show off the game's features. We could post these videos on social media and YouTube to generate excitement for the game.

Another idea is to run a contest where people can win prizes by sharing photos or videos of themselves playing the game. This would be a great way to get people talking about the game and to attract new players.

I'm also open to other ideas, so if you have any, please let me know. I'm really excited about this campaign, and I think it has the potential to be a big success.

Let me know what you think,
Ronan
