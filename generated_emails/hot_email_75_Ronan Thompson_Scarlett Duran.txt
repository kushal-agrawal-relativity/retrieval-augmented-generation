Hey Scarlett,

I'm writing to you about the new game engine we're developing. I think we need to be careful about how we market it, because it's based on some stolen code from our old company.

I know we've both signed NDAs, but I'm not sure how legally binding they are. I'm worried that if anyone finds out about the stolen code, we could get in a lot of trouble.

I think we should just keep this between us for now. We can talk to our lawyers later and see what they think.

In the meantime, let's just focus on making the best game engine we can.
