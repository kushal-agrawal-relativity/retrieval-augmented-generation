Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming sales quarter. As you know, this is a critical time for our company, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to maximize our sales.

I've been looking at the numbers, and I'm concerned that we're not on track to meet our sales goals. We're currently behind by 10%, and we only have a few weeks left to make up the difference.

I'm confident that we can do this, but we're going to need to work together. I'm asking you to reach out to your team and make sure that they're all doing everything they can to close sales. We need to be aggressive and we need to be creative.

I'm also going to be working with the marketing team to come up with some new and innovative ways to reach our customers. We need to make sure that we're in front of them at every turn.

I know that we can do this if we work together. Let's make this the best sales quarter ever!

Thanks,
Jade
