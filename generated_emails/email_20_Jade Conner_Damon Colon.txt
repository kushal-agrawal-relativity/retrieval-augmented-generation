Hi Damon,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm really excited about this project, and I think it has the potential to be a huge success.

I've been working on the marketing plan for a few weeks now, and I'm ready to share it with you. I'd love to get your feedback and input before we move forward.

I'm thinking that we should focus on a few key areas:

* **Target audience:** We need to make sure that we're targeting the right audience for this game. I think we should focus on kids ages 8-12.
* **Messaging:** We need to come up with a strong message that will resonate with our target audience. I think we should focus on the fun and exciting gameplay of Splatty McSplat.
* **Creative:** We need to create some eye-catching creative that will capture people's attention. I'm thinking we should do something with a lot of bright colors and action.

I'm still working out the details, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. Can we meet sometime this week to discuss?

Thanks,
Jade
