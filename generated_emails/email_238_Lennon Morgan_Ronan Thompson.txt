Hey Ronan,

I'm Lennon, the network admin here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm writing to you because I'm having some trouble with the new firewall you installed. I've tried everything I can think of, but I can't seem to get it working properly.

Can you take a look at it for me sometime this week? I'm available on Monday and Wednesday from 10am to 2pm.

Thanks,
Lennon
