Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I'm hoping you can give me some advice on how to best reach our target audience.

We're targeting kids aged 6-12, and we're hoping to create a campaign that will appeal to their interests and get them excited about the game. We're thinking of doing a combination of TV ads, online ads, and social media campaigns.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and if you have any ideas that we haven't thought of.

Thanks,
Ernie
