Hi Damon,

I'm reaching out to see if you have a few minutes to chat about the upcoming art budget. I know you're busy, but I wanted to get your input on what we should prioritize for the next fiscal year.

I've attached a copy of the current budget, as well as a few potential areas where we could allocate more funds. I'd love to hear your thoughts on which projects you think are most important, and if there are any other areas that you think we should be looking at.

I'm available to chat anytime this week, so just let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Victor
