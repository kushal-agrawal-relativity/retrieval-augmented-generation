Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming account manager training. I'm hoping we can schedule a time to meet and discuss the curriculum. I'd like to make sure that the training is relevant to the needs of our team and that it will help us to be more successful in our roles.

I'm also interested in hearing about any other HR initiatives that are in the works. I think it's important for us to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices in our field.

Let me know when you're free to chat.

Thanks,
Keenan
