Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty's Adventure. As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all really excited about it.

I wanted to get your thoughts on the marketing plan for the game. I'm particularly interested in your ideas for how we can reach out to new audiences and get them excited about Splatty's Adventure.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the marketing plan and let me know your thoughts by the end of the week.

Thanks,
Wilma
