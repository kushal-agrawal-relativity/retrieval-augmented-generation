Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that everything is going smoothly.

I'm particularly concerned about the software development side of things. We need to make sure that the game is stable and bug-free before we release it to the public.

I'm confident that you and your team are up to the task, but I wanted to check in and see if there's anything I can do to help.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Jade
