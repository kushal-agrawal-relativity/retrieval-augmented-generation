Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild." As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the work that you've done on the networking infrastructure for the game. I think you've done a great job, and I'm confident that it will be able to handle the massive influx of players that we're expecting.

I'm writing to ask if you could give me a status update on the networking infrastructure. I'm particularly interested in knowing how it's performing in our stress tests, and if you have any concerns about it being able to handle the launch.

I'd also like to know if you have any recommendations for how we can improve the networking infrastructure in the future.

Thanks for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Damon
