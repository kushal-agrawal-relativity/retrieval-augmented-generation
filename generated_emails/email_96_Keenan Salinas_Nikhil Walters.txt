Dear Nikhil,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of adding a new feature to our game, Splatty McSplat. I've been hearing from a lot of our players that they would like to be able to create their own levels. I think this would be a great way to increase engagement and keep players coming back for more.

I've already started working on a prototype for the level creator, and I'm confident that it will be a relatively simple addition to the game. I'm estimating that it will take about two weeks to develop and test.

I've attached a budget and a timeline for the project. I've also included a list of the resources that I'll need to complete the work.

I'd like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the project further and get your approval. I'm available anytime next week.

Thanks,
Keenan
