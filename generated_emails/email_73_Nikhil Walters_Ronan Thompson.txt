Hi Ronan,

I wanted to check in and see how things are going with the new project. I know you've been working hard on it, and I'm excited to see the progress you're making.

I'm particularly interested in the new AI system you're developing. I think it has the potential to be a real game-changer for our games.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to help.

Thanks,
Nikhil
