Hi Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent security breach that we experienced. As you know, our network was compromised by a third-party hacker, and a number of our employee's personal information was stolen.

I'm incredibly grateful for your quick response and assistance in mitigating the damage. Your expertise and dedication were essential in keeping this incident from becoming a major disaster.

I've attached a copy of the incident report for your reference. I would like to schedule a time to meet with you next week to discuss our next steps in improving our security posture.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Victor
