Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the new game design document that I'm working on. I wanted to get your input on it before I finalize it.

I've been working on this document for a few weeks now, and I think it's in a good place. But I wanted to make sure that I'm not missing anything, and that I'm taking into account all of the different aspects of game design.

I know that you're a really experienced product manager, so I was hoping that you could take a look at the document and give me some feedback. I'm specifically looking for feedback on the following:

* The overall structure of the document
* The clarity of the writing
* The accuracy of the information
* The overall feasibility of the game design

I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the document and let me know what you think. I'm available to chat over the phone or in person if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Scarlett
