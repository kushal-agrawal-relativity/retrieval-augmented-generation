Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, "Splinter Cell: Blacklist." As you know, I'm the lead account manager for this project, and I'm responsible for managing all of our relationships with our partners and customers.

I'm reaching out to you because I'm concerned about the timeline for the launch. As you know, we're scheduled to launch the game in two months, but I'm not sure if we're going to be ready.

I'm worried about a few things. First, I'm not sure if we have enough marketing materials ready. We need to have posters, flyers, and other promotional materials in place well in advance of the launch, but I'm not sure if we're going to be able to get them all done on time.

Second, I'm concerned about the game itself. I've played through the beta version, and I think it's great, but I'm not sure if it's ready for release. There are a few bugs that need to be fixed, and I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do that in time.

I know that you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take some time to talk to me about these concerns. I think it's important that we address them before it's too late.

Thanks,
Keenan
