Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming hiring event. I'm hoping we can collaborate on this to make sure we're bringing on the best possible candidates.

I think it would be helpful to have a meeting to discuss our goals for the event and come up with a plan of action. I'm available next week on Tuesday or Wednesday at 10am or 2pm.

Let me know if either of those times work for you.

Thanks,
Jade
