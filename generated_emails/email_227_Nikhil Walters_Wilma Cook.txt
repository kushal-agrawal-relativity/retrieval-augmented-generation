Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the progress of the new game engine. As you know, we've been working on this for a few months now, and I'm happy to report that we're making great progress.

We've already completed the basic architecture of the engine, and we're now working on the more complex features. I'm confident that we'll be able to deliver a high-quality product that meets our customers' expectations.

I'm also excited to announce that we've started working on a new game that will use the new engine. This is a big opportunity for us, and I'm confident that it will be a success.

I'll keep you updated on our progress, and I'll let you know as soon as we have a more concrete timeline for the release of the new engine and the new game.

Thanks,
Nikhil
