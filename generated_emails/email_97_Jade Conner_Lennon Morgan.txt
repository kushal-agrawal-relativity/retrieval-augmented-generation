Hi Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent security breach that we experienced. As you know, our network was compromised by a hacker who was able to access sensitive data.

I'm concerned that this breach may have exposed the personal information of our employees and customers. I'm asking you to work with me to investigate the breach and to take steps to protect our data from future attacks.

I understand that you're busy, but this is a top priority for the company. I'm confident that you'll be able to handle this situation effectively.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jade
