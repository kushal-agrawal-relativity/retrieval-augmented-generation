Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Spintendo Gizzard.

As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to promote it. I think that one of the most important things we can do is make sure that our website is up-to-date and informative.

I'd like to work with you to make sure that the website is optimized for search engines and that it's easy for users to find the information they're looking for. I think that this will be a great way to generate traffic to the site and drive sales.

I'm also thinking about running a contest on the website where users can win prizes for playing our game. I think this would be a fun way to engage with our fans and get them excited about the new release.

I'm open to other ideas as well, so please let me know if you have any suggestions. I'm really looking forward to working with you on this project.

Thanks,
Josiah
