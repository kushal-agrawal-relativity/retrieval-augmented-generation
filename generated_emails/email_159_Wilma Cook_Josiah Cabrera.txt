Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm really excited about this game, and I think it has the potential to be a huge hit.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can reach a wider audience with this game. We've already got a good start with our social media presence, but I think we could do more to reach people who aren't already following us.

I'm open to any ideas you have, so please let me know what you think. We're on a tight deadline, so we need to move quickly, but I'm confident that we can create something great together.

Talk to you soon,
Wilma
