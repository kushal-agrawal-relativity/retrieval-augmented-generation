Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm concerned that we're not doing enough to promote the game, and I think we're going to miss out on a lot of sales if we don't do something about it.

I've been doing some research, and I've found that our competitors are spending a lot more on marketing than we are. They're running ads on TV, radio, and social media, and they're also doing a lot of PR work. I think we need to do the same if we want to compete with them.

I'm not sure what the budget is for marketing, but I think we should at least consider doing some of the following:

* Running ads on TV, radio, and social media
* Doing PR work, such as sending out press releases and arranging interviews with journalists
* Partnering with influencers to promote the game

I think these are just a few ideas, and I'm sure there are other things we could do to promote the game. I'm open to suggestions, and I'm happy to help out in any way I can.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
