Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the new character designs for the upcoming game. I've got a few ideas that I think you'll like, but I wanted to run them by you first to get your feedback.

I'm thinking of going for a more cartoonish style this time around. I think it would be a good fit for the game's overall tone. I've attached a few sketches that I did, so you can get a sense of what I'm thinking.

Let me know what you think. I'm open to suggestions, so don't hesitate to let me know if you have any ideas of your own.

Thanks,
Damon
