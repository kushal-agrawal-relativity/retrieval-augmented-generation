Hi Damon,

I'm writing to you about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I'm really excited about the direction you're taking with the art, but I have a few concerns about how it's going to fit in with our overall branding.

I think the overall style is great, but I'm worried that the colors are too bright and the characters are too cartoonish. We want to appeal to a wide range of gamers, and I'm not sure if this is going to appeal to everyone.

I'd love to get your thoughts on this. Can we set up a time to chat this week?

Thanks,
Jade
