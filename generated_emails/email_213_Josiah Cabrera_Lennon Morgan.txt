Hi Lennon,

I'm reaching out to you because I'm looking for some information about our network infrastructure. I'm specifically interested in knowing what kind of hardware we're using, how it's all connected, and what our security measures are.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could spare a few minutes to chat with me about this. I'm available all day tomorrow, so just let me know when works best for you.

Thanks,
Josiah
