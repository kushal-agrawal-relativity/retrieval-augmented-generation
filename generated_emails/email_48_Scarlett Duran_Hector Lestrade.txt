Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on the concept for a while now, and I think I have something really exciting that will get people's attention.

I'm proposing a campaign that's based on the idea of "splatting" your enemies. We'll create a series of ads that show people getting splatted in all sorts of funny and creative ways. I think this will resonate with our target audience, which is young adults who are looking for a fun and irreverent game.

I've attached a few sketches of the ads that I'm thinking of. Let me know what you think, and I can flesh out the concept more if you're interested.

Thanks,
Scarlett
