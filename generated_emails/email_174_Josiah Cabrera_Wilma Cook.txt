Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you with an update on our marketing campaign for the new game. We've been getting some great feedback from our target audience, and I think we're on track to meet our sales goals.

I wanted to let you know that we're planning to launch a new ad campaign next week. This campaign will focus on reaching a wider audience and generating more leads. I'm confident that this will help us to continue to grow our sales.

I'll keep you updated on our progress, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

Thanks,
Josiah
