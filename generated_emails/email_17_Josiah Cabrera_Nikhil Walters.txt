Hi Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your thoughts on them.

One idea I had was to create a series of short, funny videos that would show off the game's unique features. I think this would be a great way to reach a wider audience and get people excited about the game.

Another idea I had was to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer to promote the game. This could be a great way to reach an engaged audience that is already interested in gaming.

I'm open to other ideas as well, so please let me know what you think. I'm really excited about this campaign, and I think it has the potential to be a huge success.

Thanks,
Josiah
