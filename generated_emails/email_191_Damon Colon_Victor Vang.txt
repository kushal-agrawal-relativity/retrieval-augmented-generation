Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming art show for our new game, Splatty McBlot. I'm thinking we should do something really big and flashy, like rent out a gallery in the city and invite all the bigwigs from the gaming industry. It would be a great way to get some attention for our game and hopefully generate some buzz.

I know we're on a tight budget, but I think we can make this work if we're creative. I've already been in touch with a few galleries and they're all willing to work with us. I'm also thinking we could get some sponsors to help cover the cost.

I'm really excited about this idea and I think it would be a great way to launch Splatty McBlot. Let me know what you think and we can start working out the details.

Thanks,
Damon
