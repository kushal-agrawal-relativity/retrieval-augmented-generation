Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent account turnover. As you know, we've lost a number of key accounts in the past few months, and I'm concerned about the impact this is having on our bottom line.

I'd like to work with you to develop a plan to retain our existing accounts and attract new ones. I think we need to focus on providing our customers with a better experience, and I believe that you can play a key role in making that happen.

I'm open to any ideas you have, and I'm confident that we can work together to turn things around.

Let's chat soon,
Victor
