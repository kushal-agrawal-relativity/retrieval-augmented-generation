Hi Ronan,

I wanted to check in about the status of the new networking infrastructure. I know you're working on it with Damon, and I'm just curious to know when you think it'll be ready to go live.

We're starting to get a lot of requests from our developers to start testing it out, so I just want to make sure we're on track.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Lennon
