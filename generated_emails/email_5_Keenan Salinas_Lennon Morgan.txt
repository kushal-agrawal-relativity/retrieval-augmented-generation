Hi Lennon,

I'm Keenan, the Lead Account Manager here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out to you because I'm having some trouble with our login system. I'm not sure if it's a problem on my end or if it's a broader issue, but I can't seem to log in to the system at all.

I've tried resetting my password, but that didn't work. I've also tried contacting IT, but they haven't been able to help me either.

I'm hoping you can take a look at this and see if you can figure out what's going on. I'm really starting to get behind on my work because I can't access the system.

Thanks for your help,
Keenan
