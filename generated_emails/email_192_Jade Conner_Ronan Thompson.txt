Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatoon 3." As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm specifically reaching out to you because I know that you're the lead software engineer on the project, and I wanted to get your input on a few things.

First, I'm wondering if you have any concerns about the timeline for the release. We're currently scheduled to launch the game in Q4 of this year, but I'm wondering if you think that's realistic.

Second, I'm curious to know what your thoughts are on the marketing plan for the game. We've already started to put some things in place, but I'm open to hearing any suggestions you might have.

Finally, I'd like to get your thoughts on the pricing for the game. We're still undecided on what we want to charge, but I'm hoping you can give me some guidance on this.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take some time to think about these things and get back to me with your thoughts.

Thanks,
Jade
