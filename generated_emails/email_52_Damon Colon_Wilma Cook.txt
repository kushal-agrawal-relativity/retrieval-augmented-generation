Hi Wilma,

I'm Damon Colon, the Head of Art here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming art assets for our new game, Splatty McBlot.

I've been working with the design team to come up with some concept art for the game, and I think we're really starting to hit our stride. I'm particularly excited about the character designs for the main characters, Splatty and McBlot. They're really coming to life, and I think players are going to love them.

I'm also working on the environmental art for the game. I'm still in the early stages of this, but I'm already coming up with some cool ideas for the different levels. I'm thinking of having a level set in a swamp, a level set in a desert, and a level set in a forest. I think it's going to be a lot of fun to create these different environments and see how they come together in the game.

I'm still a few weeks away from having all of the art assets finished, but I wanted to give you a heads up on what I'm working on. I'm confident that we're going to create some amazing art for Splatty McBlot, and I can't wait to see it come to life in the game.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Damon
