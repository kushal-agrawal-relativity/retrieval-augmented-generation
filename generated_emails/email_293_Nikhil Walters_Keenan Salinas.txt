Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're expecting a lot of traffic to our website. I'm concerned that our current account management team won't be able to handle the influx of new customers, and I'm wondering if you could lend a hand.

Would you be willing to work with our account managers to provide support during the launch? I think your experience in customer service would be invaluable, and it would help us to ensure that our customers have a positive experience.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Nikhil
