Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of layoffs. As you know, we've been facing some financial challenges lately, and we need to make some tough decisions in order to stay afloat.

I know that this is a difficult time for everyone, but I want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to support our employees through this transition. We're providing severance packages and outplacement services to help people find new jobs.

I'm also committed to making sure that we learn from this experience and come out of it stronger than ever. We're already taking steps to improve our financial situation, and we're confident that we'll be able to weather this storm.

I appreciate your understanding during this difficult time. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,
Victor
