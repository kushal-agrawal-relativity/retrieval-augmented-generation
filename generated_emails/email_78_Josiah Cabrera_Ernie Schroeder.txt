Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we could do a big social media push, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We could create some fun and engaging content that would appeal to our target audience. We could also run some paid ads to reach a wider audience.

I'm also considering doing some traditional marketing, like print ads and TV commercials. I think this would be a good way to reach people who aren't on social media.

I'm still in the early stages of planning, so I'm open to any suggestions you have. What do you think about my ideas? Are there any other marketing strategies you think we should consider?

Let me know what you think. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Josiah
