Hey Ernie,

I've been looking at the recent spike in login failures, and I think it might be due to a DDoS attack. I've already started monitoring the traffic and I'm working on a plan to mitigate the attack. I'll keep you updated on my progress.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon
