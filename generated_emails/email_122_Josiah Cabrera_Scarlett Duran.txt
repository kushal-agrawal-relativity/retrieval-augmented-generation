Hey Scarlett,

I just wanted to reach out and see how you're feeling about the new marketing campaign. I know it's been a lot of work, but I'm really excited about the potential it has to bring in new customers.

I'm especially interested in hearing your thoughts on the new ad campaign we're running on social media. I think it's a really clever way to reach our target audience, but I'd love to hear your feedback before we launch it.

Let me know if you have time to chat this week. I'm free on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons.

Thanks,
Josiah
