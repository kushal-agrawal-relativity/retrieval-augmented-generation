Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of layoffs. As you know, we've been facing some tough financial times lately, and we've had to make some difficult decisions about our workforce.

I know that this is a difficult time for everyone involved, and I want to thank you for your hard work and dedication to Spintendo Gizzard. I'm confident that you'll continue to be a valuable asset to our team, even as we go through this transition.

I've attached a list of the employees who will be affected by the layoffs. I've also included a severance package that we're offering to all affected employees.

I know that this news will be difficult to hear, but I want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to support our employees during this transition. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Sincerely,
Wilma
