Hi Jade,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming financial projections for the company. As you know, we're facing some challenging times in the market, and it's important that we make sure we're on track to meet our financial goals.

I've attached a copy of the projections for you to review. I'd like you to take a look at them and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

I'm also going to be scheduling a meeting for next week to discuss the projections in more detail. I'll send you the details as soon as I have them.

Thanks,
Wilma
