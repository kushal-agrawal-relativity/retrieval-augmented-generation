Hi Wilma,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of expanding our account management team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and I think it's time we added some more people to help manage our growing client base.

I've been doing some research, and I think we could really benefit from hiring a couple of Account Executives. These individuals would be responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with our existing clients, as well as identifying and pursuing new opportunities.

I've attached a job description and a salary range for your review. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about this proposal.

Thanks,
Keenan
