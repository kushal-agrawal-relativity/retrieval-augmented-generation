Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the new game design concept I've been working on. I think it has the potential to be a really big hit, and I'd love to get your thoughts on it.

The basic idea is for a new kind of platformer where the player can control the gravity. This would allow for some really cool and unique gameplay possibilities. I've attached a few sketches that I've done to give you a better idea of what I'm thinking.

I'm still in the early stages of development, but I'm excited about the potential of this concept. I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

Thanks,
Scarlett
