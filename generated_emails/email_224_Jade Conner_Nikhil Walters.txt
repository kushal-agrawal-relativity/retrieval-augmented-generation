Hi Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming financial projections for the next quarter. As you know, we're facing some challenges due to the recent economic downturn, but I'm confident that we can weather the storm if we work together.

I've attached a copy of the projections for your review. I'd like to schedule a time to meet with you next week to discuss them in more detail.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Jade
