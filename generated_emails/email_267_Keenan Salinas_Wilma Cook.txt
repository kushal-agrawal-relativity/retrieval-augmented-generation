Hi Wilma,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming sales quarter. As you know, this is our most important quarter of the year, and we need to make sure we're on track to meet our sales goals.

I've been working with the sales team, and we've developed a plan to increase our sales by 15%. We're confident that this plan will help us achieve our goals.

I'm also reaching out to you to request your support. I know that you're busy, but I would appreciate it if you could take some time to meet with me to discuss our sales plan. I think it would be helpful to get your feedback and support.

I'm available to meet with you at your convenience. Please let me know if you're interested.

Thanks,
Keenan
