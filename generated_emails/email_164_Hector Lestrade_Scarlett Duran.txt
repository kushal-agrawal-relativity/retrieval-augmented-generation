Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we get the marketing right.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the campaign's target audience. Who do you think we should be targeting? What kind of messaging do you think will resonate with them?

I'd love to get your input on this as soon as possible. We're on a tight timeline, so the sooner we can get started, the better.

Thanks,
Hector
