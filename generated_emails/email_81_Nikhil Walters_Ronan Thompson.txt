Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild." As you know, this is our most ambitious game to date, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the new physics engine that we're using for this game. It's going to allow us to create some really amazing effects, like realistic water and fire. I think it's going to be a real game-changer.

I'm also really happy with the work that you've been doing on the AI for the game. The enemies are going to be much more challenging than in previous games, and I think it's going to make the game a lot more fun.

I know that you're working hard on this game, and I just wanted to say thanks for all your hard work. I'm really looking forward to seeing the finished product.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Nikhil
