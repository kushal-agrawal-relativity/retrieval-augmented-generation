Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming round of layoffs. I'm concerned about the impact this will have on our team, and I'm wondering if there's anything we can do to mitigate the damage.

I know that these layoffs are necessary for the company's financial health, but I'm worried about the morale of the remaining employees. I'm concerned that they'll be afraid for their jobs, and that this will lead to a decrease in productivity.

I'm also concerned about the impact this will have on our ability to deliver on our projects. We're in the middle of a major development cycle, and I'm worried that losing some of our key people will set us back.

I'm not sure what the answer is, but I wanted to put my concerns on the table. I'm open to discussing this further with you, and I'm willing to help in any way I can.

Thanks,
Scarlett
