Hi Ernie,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming product launch of our new game, "Splodey Squirrel." As you know, this is a big project for the company, and we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure its success.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the marketing plan for the game. We've already put together a few ideas, but I'd love to hear your feedback and get your input on how we can best reach our target audience.

I'm also open to any other suggestions you have for the launch. We want this game to be a huge success, and I'm confident that we can achieve that goal with your help.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to meet up to discuss this further.

Thanks,
Victor
