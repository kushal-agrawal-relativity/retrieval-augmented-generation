Hi Keenan,

I'm Damon, the Head of Art here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out to you because I'm working on a new project and I need your help.

I'm designing a new character for our upcoming game, and I'm having trouble coming up with a good design. I was hoping you could take a look at my sketches and give me some feedback.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could spare a few minutes to help me out. I think this character could be really great, but I need your help to make it perfect.

Thanks in advance,
Damon
