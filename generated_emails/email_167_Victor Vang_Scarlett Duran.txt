Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming game design competition. As you know, we're looking for new and innovative ideas for our next game.

I think you'd be a great fit for this competition, and I encourage you to submit your entry. I know you have a lot of talent, and I think your work would be a great addition to our team.

The competition is open to all employees of Spintendo Gizzard, so if you have any friends or colleagues who you think would be a good fit, please encourage them to participate as well.

The deadline for submissions is March 1st, so please get your entry in as soon as possible.

I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

Best,
Victor
