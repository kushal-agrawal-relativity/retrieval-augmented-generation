Hi Josiah,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big game for us, and we need to make sure that we get the marketing right.

I'm thinking that we should focus on a social media campaign. We can create some fun and engaging content that will get people excited about the game. We can also partner with some influencers to help spread the word.

I'm open to your ideas, so let me know what you think. We need to get started on this soon, so let's chat soon.

Thanks,
Hector
