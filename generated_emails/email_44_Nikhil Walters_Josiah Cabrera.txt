Hey Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatalot. I'm really excited about this project, and I think it has the potential to be a huge success.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can use social media to reach our target audience. I think we could do a lot of really creative things with this, and I'm eager to hear your ideas.

I'm also open to suggestions on how we can improve our website and make it more user-friendly. I think this is an important part of any marketing campaign, and I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to make it easy for people to find out more about our game.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at these ideas and let me know what you think. I'm available to chat anytime this week, so just let me know when you're free.

Thanks,
Nikhil
