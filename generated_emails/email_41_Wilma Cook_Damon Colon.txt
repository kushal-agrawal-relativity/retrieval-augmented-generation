Hi Damon,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming art project for our new game. I'm really excited about the direction you're taking with the designs, and I think they're really going to capture the spirit of the game.

I wanted to get your thoughts on a few things before we move forward. First, I'm wondering if you think we should add any more characters to the game. I think it would be cool to have a few more options for players to choose from, but I don't want to overwhelm the game with too many characters.

Second, I'm wondering about the color palette. I think the colors you've chosen so far are great, but I'm wondering if we could add a little more contrast. I think it would help the characters and objects stand out more from the background.

Finally, I'm wondering if you have any ideas for how we can incorporate more interactive elements into the art. I think it would be really cool if players could interact with the environment in some way.

I know this is a lot to think about, but I'm really excited to see what you come up with. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Wilma
