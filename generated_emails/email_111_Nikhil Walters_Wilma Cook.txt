Hi Wilma,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the progress of the new game engine. As you know, we're on track to meet our deadline for the alpha release, but I wanted to run a few things by you before we move forward.

First, I'm concerned about the scope of the project. We've added a lot of features since we started, and I'm worried that we're biting off more than we can chew. I think we need to trim back the list of features and focus on the most important ones.

Second, I'm concerned about the budget. The cost of the project has been increasing, and I'm not sure if we have the funds to complete everything we want. I think we need to have a frank discussion with the stakeholders about what we can and can't afford.

Finally, I'm concerned about the timeline. We're already behind schedule, and I'm not sure if we can meet the alpha release date. I think we need to be realistic about what we can achieve in the time we have.

I know these are all challenging issues, but I think it's important to address them before we move forward. I'm happy to discuss them further with you at your convenience.

Thanks,
Nikhil
