Hey Scarlett,

I've been working on some new concept art for the next game, and I wanted to get your thoughts on it. I'm thinking of going with a more stylized look this time, something that's a little more in line with the current trends.

I've attached a few files to this email, so take a look and let me know what you think. If you have any ideas of your own, I'd love to hear them.

I'm hoping to have a finalized design by the end of the week, so if you have any feedback, please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Damon
