Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to follow up on our conversation yesterday about the new account management software. I've been doing some research, and I think I've found a few options that might be a good fit for our company.

I've attached a spreadsheet with a comparison of the different software packages. I've also included a brief summary of each one, as well as my thoughts on which one might be the best choice for us.

I'd love to chat with you more about this next week to see if we can come to a decision. Let me know what works best for your schedule.

Thanks,
Keenan
