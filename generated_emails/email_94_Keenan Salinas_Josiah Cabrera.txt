Hi Josiah,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splatty McBlast." I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that feature the characters from the game. These videos could be used to promote the game on social media and YouTube.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber who could make a video about the game. This would be a great way to reach a new audience.

I'm also considering running a contest on social media where fans can create their own artwork or videos inspired by the game. This would be a fun way to engage with our fans and get them excited about the game.

I'm open to other ideas as well. What do you think about these? Do you have any other suggestions?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Keenan
