Hi Josiah,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splatty McSplatface." I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that promote the game. The videos would be posted on social media and YouTube. I think this would be a great way to reach a wider audience and get people excited about the game.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer. This would be a great way to get our game in front of a new audience. We could offer the YouTuber or streamer early access to the game, or we could even pay them to promote it.

I'm open to other ideas as well. What do you think? What kind of marketing campaign would you recommend for "Splatty McSplatface"?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Jade
