Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I think we should focus on creating a buzz around the game before it's released. We could do this by releasing some teaser trailers, running contests, and getting influencers to play the game. I've also been thinking about creating a dedicated website for the game, where people can learn more about it and sign up for updates.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at my ideas and let me know what you think. I'm available to chat anytime this week.

Thanks,
Hector
