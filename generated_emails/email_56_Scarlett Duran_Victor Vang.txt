Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming round of layoffs. I know this is a difficult time for everyone, but I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help the team through this transition.

I've been thinking about how we can support our employees who are being laid off, and I have a few ideas. First, I think we should offer them a severance package that includes a few months of pay and assistance with finding a new job. I also think we should provide them with outplacement services, such as resume writing and interview coaching.

I know that these are just a few ideas, but I hope they can help. I'm here to support you and the team during this difficult time, and I'm open to any other suggestions you might have.

Thanks,
Scarlett
