Hi Josiah,

I'm Lennon, the network administrator here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out because I noticed that our website is having some trouble loading. I've checked the logs and it looks like there's a problem with the DNS server. I'm working on a fix now, but I wanted to give you a heads up in case you hear any complaints from users.

I'll keep you updated on my progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon
