Hey Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure.

As you know, Splatty's Adventure is a 3D platformer that's aimed at kids ages 6-12. We're hoping to create a big marketing push for the game, and I think you could be a valuable asset to the team.

I'm particularly interested in your experience with social media marketing. I think you could help us reach a wider audience for Splatty's Adventure by creating engaging content and promoting the game on social media.

I'm also interested in your thoughts on how we can best target our marketing efforts. We want to make sure that we're reaching the right people with our message.

I'd love to set up some time to chat with you about this further. Are you free for a meeting this week?

Thanks,
Hector
