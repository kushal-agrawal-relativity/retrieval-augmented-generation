Hey Ronan,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any availability this week to chat about the new product roadmap. I'm particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on the new features we're planning to add to our flagship game.

I'm free on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, and Thursday morning. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Ernie
