Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming art project for our new game. I've been working on some initial concepts, and I wanted to get your thoughts before I move forward.

I'm thinking that we go for a more stylized look this time around. Something that's really eye-catching and memorable. I've been looking at some of the work that's being done by indie studios, and I think there's a lot of potential there.

I'm also thinking that we could do something a little more experimental. Maybe we try out a new art style, or use some new technology. I think it would be a great opportunity to push the boundaries of what's possible.

Of course, I'm open to your feedback. What do you think? Are you on board with this direction? Or do you have other ideas in mind?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Damon
