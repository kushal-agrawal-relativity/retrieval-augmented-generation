Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of hiring a new software engineer. As you know, our team has been growing rapidly over the past few months, and we're starting to reach a point where we need to add some more people to help with the workload.

I've been doing some research, and I think I've found a few candidates who would be a good fit for our team. I'd like to set up some time to chat with you about them and get your thoughts.

Would you be available to meet with me sometime this week? I'm free on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons.

Thanks,
Ronan
