Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you about the recent security breach. I know you're as concerned about this as I am, and I wanted to see if you had any ideas on how we can move forward.

As you know, we've been investigating the breach for a few weeks now, and we still haven't been able to identify the source. This is very concerning, as it means that our data is still at risk.

I'm worried that if we don't find a way to fix this, it could damage our reputation and our bottom line. We're a small company, and we can't afford to lose customers' trust.

I know that you're working hard on this, and I appreciate your dedication. I'm confident that we'll be able to figure this out, but in the meantime, I'd like to keep this between us. If word gets out that we've been hacked, it could be really bad for business.

Thanks for your time,
Nikhil
