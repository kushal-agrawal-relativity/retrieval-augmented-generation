Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any availability this week to chat about the new art assets for the upcoming game release. I'm particularly interested in seeing the final versions of the character models and the concept art for the new levels.

I know you're busy, but I think it would be really helpful to get your feedback on these assets before we move forward with the next phase of development. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's a better time to chat.

Thanks,
Ernie
