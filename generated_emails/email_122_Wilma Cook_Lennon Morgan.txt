Hi Lennon,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in DDoS attacks on our network. As you know, these attacks have been disruptive to our business and have caused us to lose valuable customer data.

I'm concerned that these attacks are only going to get worse, so I'm asking you to take a leading role in developing a plan to mitigate them. I want you to work with our security team to identify the vulnerabilities in our network and develop solutions to address them. I also want you to work with our legal team to explore our options for taking legal action against the attackers.

I know that this is a lot to ask, but I'm confident that you're up to the challenge. You're a talented network administrator and I know that you'll be able to come up with a solution that will keep our network safe.

I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Wilma
