Hi Hector,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splinter Cell: Blacklist." I've been working on the campaign with Josiah Cabrera, our Head of Marketing, and we're really excited about the direction it's taking.

We're planning to launch a multi-platform campaign that will include social media, paid advertising, and PR outreach. We're also working on developing some unique marketing assets, such as a short film and a series of blog posts.

I'd love to get your input on the campaign as we continue to develop it. Do you have any ideas or suggestions that you think would be beneficial?

I'm also wondering if you'd be available to meet with me and Josiah next week to discuss the campaign in more detail.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Keenan
