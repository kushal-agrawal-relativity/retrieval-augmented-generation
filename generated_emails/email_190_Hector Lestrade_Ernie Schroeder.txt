Hey Ernie,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure.

As you know, this is a big game for us, and we're really excited to get it out there. I think we have a great opportunity to make a big splash with this one, but we need to make sure we do it right.

I've been thinking about a few different ways to approach the marketing campaign, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to focus on the game's unique features. Splatty's Adventure is a platformer with a twist - the player can control the direction of the gravity. This opens up a lot of possibilities for gameplay, and I think it's something that could really set the game apart from the competition.

Another idea is to focus on the game's story. Splatty's Adventure is a coming-of-age story about a young boy who discovers his inner hero. I think this is a story that a lot of people can relate to, and it could be a powerful way to connect with players.

Of course, these are just a few ideas. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on other approaches.

I think we need to make a decision about the marketing campaign soon, so we can start putting things in motion. I'm available to chat anytime this week if you want to brainstorm some more.

Thanks,
Hector
