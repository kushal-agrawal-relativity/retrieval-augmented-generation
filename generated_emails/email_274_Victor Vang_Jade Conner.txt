Hi Jade,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of performance reviews. As you know, these reviews are an important opportunity for us to assess our employees' performance and identify areas where they can improve.

I've attached a copy of the performance review form for your reference. I've also included a list of the criteria that we'll be using to evaluate each employee.

I'd like to schedule a time to meet with you to discuss your performance review. Would you be available for a meeting next week?

Thanks,
Victor
