Hi Josiah,

I'm reaching out to you about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I've been working on some ideas, and I'd love to get your thoughts on them.

I'm thinking we could do a big social media push, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We could create some fun, engaging content that would appeal to our target audience. I also think it would be a good idea to partner with some influencers who could help us reach a wider audience.

I'm still in the early stages of planning, but I'm excited about the potential of this campaign. I think it could be a really great way to generate buzz and excitement for our new game.

Would you be able to take a look at my ideas and give me some feedback? I'm available for a meeting later this week if you're interested.

Thanks,
Scarlett
