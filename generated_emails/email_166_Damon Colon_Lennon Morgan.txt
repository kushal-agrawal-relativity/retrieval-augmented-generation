Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game. As you know, we're planning to release the game on a variety of platforms, and I need your help to make sure that the game is properly optimized for each platform.

I'm specifically interested in making sure that the game runs smoothly on low-end devices. We know that a lot of our players are using older devices, so it's important that the game doesn't lag or crash on these devices.

I'm confident that you'll be able to handle this, but if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Damon
