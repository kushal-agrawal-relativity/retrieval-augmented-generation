Hey Ernie,

I'm Damon Colon, the Head of Art here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out to you because I'm a little concerned about the progress of the new game we're working on. I know you're the Product Manager, so I wanted to get your thoughts on where we're at and what we can do to improve.

From my perspective, it seems like we're still in the early stages of development. We have a lot of ideas, but we haven't really nailed down a solid concept yet. I'm worried that we're going to run out of time and we won't be able to deliver a quality product.

I'm not sure what the best solution is, but I think we need to have a serious discussion about where we're going with this game. I'm happy to meet with you whenever you're free.

Thanks,
Damon
