Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm really excited about this project, and I think it has the potential to be a huge success.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can reach a wider audience with this game. We've already got a good following on social media, but I think we could do more to reach people who aren't already familiar with our brand.

I'm open to any ideas you have, so please don't hesitate to share them. I'm also happy to set up a time to chat more about this if you'd like.

Thanks,
Wilma
