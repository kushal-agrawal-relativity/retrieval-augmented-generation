Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming game design competition. As you know, we're looking for new and innovative ideas for our next game. The winning entry will receive a cash prize and a chance to have their game developed by our team.

I'm excited to announce that you've been selected as one of the judges for the competition. This is a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills and expertise. I know you'll do a great job.

The competition will be held on February 25th at our headquarters. The submissions will be judged on originality, creativity, and feasibility. The winner will be announced at the end of the event.

I've attached the full details of the competition to this email. Please let me know if you have any questions.

I'm looking forward to seeing you at the competition!

Best,
Victor
