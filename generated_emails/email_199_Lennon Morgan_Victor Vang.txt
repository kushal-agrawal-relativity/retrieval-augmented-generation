Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of upgrading our company's network infrastructure. As you know, our current network is starting to show its age, and we're starting to experience some performance issues.

I've been doing some research, and I think that we could really benefit from upgrading to a new, more scalable network. A new network would allow us to support more users and devices, and it would also provide us with better performance and security.

I've attached a proposal that outlines the benefits of upgrading our network, as well as some cost estimates. I'd love to set up a time to discuss this further with you.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Lennon
