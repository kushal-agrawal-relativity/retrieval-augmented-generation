Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you about the recent network outages we've been experiencing. I've been doing some digging, and I think I've found the source of the problem.

It looks like there's a bug in the code that's responsible for routing traffic between our different servers. I'm working on a fix now, and I should have it deployed by the end of the day.

In the meantime, I'd recommend that you avoid using any non-essential network resources. This will help to reduce the load on the system and prevent further outages.

I'll keep you updated on my progress. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon
