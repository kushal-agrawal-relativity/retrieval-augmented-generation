Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming game design competition. As you know, we're looking for new and innovative ideas for our next game. The competition is open to all employees, and the winner will receive a cash prize and a chance to have their game concept developed into a full-fledged game.

I'm particularly excited about this competition because it's a great opportunity for our employees to show off their creativity and passion for game design. I think it's also a great way to get new ideas for our future games.

If you're interested in participating in the competition, please send me a brief description of your game concept by the end of the week. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have about the competition.

I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

Best,
Victor
