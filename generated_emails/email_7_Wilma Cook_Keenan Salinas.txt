Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure its success.

One of the things that I'm concerned about is our account management strategy. We need to make sure that we're reaching out to the right people and that we're providing them with the information they need to make a decision about our game.

I'm confident that you're the right person to lead this effort. You have a proven track record of success in account management, and I know that you'll be able to get the job done.

I'm looking forward to working with you on this project. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,
Wilma
