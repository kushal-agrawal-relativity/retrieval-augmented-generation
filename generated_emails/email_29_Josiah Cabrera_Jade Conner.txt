Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I think we should focus on two main things: 1) generating awareness of the game, and 2) driving sales. To do this, I'm thinking we could do a combination of paid advertising, social media, and influencer marketing.

For paid advertising, I'd suggest targeting gamers on social media and YouTube. We could also run some ads on Google Search, but I think the social media and YouTube ads would be more effective.

For social media, we could create a dedicated Splatty McSplat account and post regular updates about the game. We could also run contests and giveaways to generate excitement.

As for influencer marketing, we could reach out to popular gaming YouTubers and Twitch streamers and see if they'd be interested in playing Splatty McSplat and talking about it on their channels.

I think this is a good starting point, but I'm open to other ideas. What do you think?

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Josiah
