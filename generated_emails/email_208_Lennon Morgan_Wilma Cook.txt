Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in network outages. As you know, our network has been unstable for the past few weeks, and this has caused a number of problems for our employees and customers.

I've been working with our team to troubleshoot the issue, and we believe that we have identified the source of the problem. We're currently working on a fix, and I expect that the network will be back to normal within the next few days.

I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused, and I appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this issue.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Best,
Lennon
