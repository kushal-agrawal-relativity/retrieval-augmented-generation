Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McBlot. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we could do a big social media push, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We could create some fun and engaging content that would get people excited about the game. I'm also thinking about running some paid ads, targeting people who are interested in gaming.

I'm open to other ideas, too. What do you think would be the best way to reach our target audience?

I'm available to chat anytime this week. Just let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Josiah
