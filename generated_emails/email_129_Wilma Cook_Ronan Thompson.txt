Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the progress of the new game engine. I'm really excited about the work you and your team have been doing, and I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

I wanted to get your thoughts on a few things. First, I'm wondering if you think we should add any new features to the engine. We've already got a lot of great stuff, but I'm always open to suggestions.

Second, I'm wondering how long you think it will take to finish the engine. I know you're working hard, but I'm also eager to get it out into the world.

Finally, I wanted to talk about the budget for the engine. I'm happy to give you whatever you need, but I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

I'm available to chat anytime this week. Just let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Wilma
