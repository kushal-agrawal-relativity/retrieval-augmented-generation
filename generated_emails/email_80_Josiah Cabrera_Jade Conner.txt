Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm thinking that we should focus on social media advertising, and I'd like to get your thoughts on the matter.

I think that social media is a great way to reach our target audience, which is millennials. We can create engaging content that will get people talking about our game, and we can also run targeted ads to reach people who are already interested in games like Splatty McSplat.

I've attached a few ideas for social media posts that we could use. I'm also open to hearing your own ideas.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Josiah
