Hey Ronan,

I'm reaching out to you to discuss the progress on the new game engine. I know you're working hard on it, and I just wanted to check in and see if there's anything I can do to help.

I'm particularly interested in the new physics engine. I think it has the potential to be a real game-changer, and I'm excited to see how it's going to work in the new game.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to help.

Thanks,
Ernie
