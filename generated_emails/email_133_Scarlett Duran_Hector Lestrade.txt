Hey Hector,

I wanted to run an idea by you for a new marketing campaign. I've been thinking about how we can reach a wider audience with our games, and I think we could do a lot with some influencer marketing.

I know we've tried this in the past, but I think we could do it better this time. We could partner with some bigger YouTubers and Twitch streamers who play games like ours. They could give us shout-outs and play our games on their channels, which would expose our games to a whole new audience.

I think this would be a great way to get more people interested in our games and drive sales. What do you think?

Let me know if you want to chat more about it.

Scarlett
