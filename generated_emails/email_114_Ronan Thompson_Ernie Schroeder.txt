Hey Ernie,

I'm Ronan, the lead software engineer here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out because I'm having some trouble with the new build of the game engine. I think there's a bug in the physics simulation that's causing the characters to glitch out.

I've been working on debugging it for a few days now, but I can't seem to find the issue. I was hoping you could take a look and see if you can spot anything I'm missing.

The build is located in the following directory:

/home/ronan/projects/spintendo-gizzard/engine/build/

The bug is most noticeable when you're playing the game in first-person mode. The characters will sometimes start to jitter and teleport around.

I'd appreciate it if you could take a look and let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ronan
