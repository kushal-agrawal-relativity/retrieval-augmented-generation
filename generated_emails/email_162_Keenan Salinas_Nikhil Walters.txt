Hi Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a major release for us, and I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

I'm reaching out to you because I'm concerned about the marketing campaign for the game. I think we need to do more to reach out to potential players and generate excitement for the game.

I've been doing some research, and I've found a few marketing strategies that I think could be really effective. I'd like to discuss these with you and get your thoughts.

I'm also concerned about the budget for the marketing campaign. I think we need to make sure that we have enough money to do the campaign justice.

I'm available to meet with you at your convenience to discuss these issues. Please let me know when would be a good time for you.

Thanks,
Keenan
