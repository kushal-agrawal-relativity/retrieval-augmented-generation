Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of adding a new position to our team: a Head of Recruiting.

As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and we're expecting to continue to grow at a similar pace in the coming year. This growth is putting a strain on our current recruiting team, and we're finding it difficult to keep up with the demand.

A Head of Recruiting would be responsible for developing and executing our recruiting strategy, sourcing and screening candidates, and managing the hiring process. This role would be critical to our continued growth, and I believe it would be a valuable addition to our team.

I've attached a job description for the Head of Recruiting position, and I'd love to get your thoughts on it. I'm also happy to discuss this further with you in person if you'd like.

Thanks,
Nikhil
