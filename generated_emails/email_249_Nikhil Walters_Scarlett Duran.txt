Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you about the new game design initiative that we're working on. I'm really excited about the potential for this project, and I think that your expertise would be invaluable to the team.

I'm particularly interested in your work on the [insert game title] project. I think that your approach to game design is really innovative, and I would love to learn more about how you think about the process.

I know that you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the project proposal and let me know what you think. I'm available to chat anytime this week if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Nikhil
