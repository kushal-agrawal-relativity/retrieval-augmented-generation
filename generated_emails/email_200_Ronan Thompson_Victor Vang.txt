Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of adding a new software engineer to our team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and our current team is starting to reach capacity. I think adding another engineer would help us to continue to meet the demands of our growing customer base.

I've been doing some research, and I think I've found a few candidates who would be a good fit for our team. I'd like to set up some time to chat with you about them and get your feedback.

Are you available for a meeting sometime this week?

Thanks,
Ronan
