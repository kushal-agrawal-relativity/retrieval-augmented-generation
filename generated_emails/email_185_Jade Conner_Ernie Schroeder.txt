Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." I wanted to get your thoughts on the marketing plan we've put together.

As you know, this is our most ambitious game yet, and we're expecting a lot of excitement from our fans. We want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to promote the game and get people excited to play it.

The marketing plan we've put together includes a mix of traditional and digital marketing channels. We're planning on running TV ads, social media campaigns, and online advertising. We're also going to be doing some in-person events, like a launch party and a booth at a gaming convention.

I'd love to get your feedback on this plan. Do you think we're missing anything? Are there any areas where we could improve?

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the plan and let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Jade
