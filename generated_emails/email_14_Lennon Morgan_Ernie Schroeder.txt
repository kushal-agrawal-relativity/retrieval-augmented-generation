Hey Ernie,

I'm Lennon, the network admin here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out to you because I noticed that there's been a recent increase in DDoS attacks on our servers. I'm working on a plan to mitigate these attacks, but I wanted to get your thoughts on the matter first.

Do you have any experience with DDoS attacks? If so, what measures have you taken to mitigate them? I'm also open to any suggestions you might have.

Thanks,
Lennon
