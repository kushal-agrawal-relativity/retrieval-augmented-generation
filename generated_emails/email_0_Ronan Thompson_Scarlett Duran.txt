Hey Scarlett,

I'm reaching out to see if you'd be interested in collaborating on a new project. I've been working on a new AI engine that I think could be really helpful for your game design work, and I'd love to get your feedback on it.

I'm free to chat this week if you're interested. Let me know what works for you.

Best,
Ronan
