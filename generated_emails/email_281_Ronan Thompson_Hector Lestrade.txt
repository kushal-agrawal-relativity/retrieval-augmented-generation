Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game. I've been working on the game's code, and I think it's in a good place to start promoting it.

I've got a few ideas for how we can market the game, but I'd like to hear your thoughts first. Do you have any ideas for how we can reach our target audience?

I'm also wondering if you have any contacts at any gaming publications that we could reach out to. I think it would be a great opportunity to get some early reviews of the game.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ronan
