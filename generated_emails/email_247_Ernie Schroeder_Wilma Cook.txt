Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Super Mario Bros. 35." I'm excited to report that we're on track for a launch date of March 31st, and I'm confident that the game is going to be a huge success.

I've attached a copy of the latest marketing plan for your review. As you can see, we're planning a major marketing campaign that will include TV, print, and online advertising. We're also working with influencers to create content that will generate excitement for the game.

I'm confident that this campaign will help us to reach our target audience and drive sales. I'm also confident that "Super Mario Bros. 35" is going to be a hit with gamers of all ages.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ernie
