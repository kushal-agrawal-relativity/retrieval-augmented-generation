Hi Damon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming art assets for our new game, "Splatty McSplat." I've been looking over the designs you've submitted so far, and I have a few thoughts I'd like to share.

First of all, I love the overall style of the art. It's bright, colorful, and fun, which is exactly what we're going for with this game. However, I think some of the characters could be more expressive. For example, the main character, Splatty McSplat, looks a little too stoic. I think he could use a bigger smile and some more animated eyes.

I also have a few suggestions for the backgrounds. I think they could be more detailed and varied. For example, the first level takes place in a forest, but all of the trees look the same. I think it would be more interesting if each tree had a unique shape and color.

I know you're a busy guy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at my suggestions and make some revisions. I think it would really help to improve the overall quality of the game.

Thanks,
Jade
