Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent security breach that we experienced. As you know, this was a serious incident that could have had a significant impact on our company.

I'm grateful for your quick response and the steps you took to mitigate the damage. I'm also impressed by the way you communicated with our customers and stakeholders during this difficult time.

I'm writing to you today to ask for your help in making sure that this never happens again. I'd like to work with you to develop a comprehensive security plan that will protect our company from future threats.

I know that you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at this proposal and let me know what you think. I'm available to discuss this further at your convenience.

Thanks,
Hector
