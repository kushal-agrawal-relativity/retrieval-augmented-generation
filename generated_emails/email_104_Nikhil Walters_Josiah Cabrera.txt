Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that show off the game's unique features. I think this would be a great way to get people excited about the game and to generate some buzz.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer to promote the game. This could be a great way to reach a wider audience and to get people who are already interested in gaming to check out Splatty's Adventure.

I'm open to other ideas as well, so please let me know what you think. We need to come up with a plan soon, so we can get started on the campaign.

Thanks,
Nikhil
