Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming PR campaign for our new game, Spintendo Gizzard. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short videos that highlight the different features of the game. We could also do some paid advertising on social media to promote the videos.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer to play the game and give their thoughts on it. This could be a great way to reach a wider audience.

I'm also open to other ideas, so please let me know what you think. We need to get this campaign started as soon as possible, so let's chat soon to come up with a plan.

Thanks,
Hector
