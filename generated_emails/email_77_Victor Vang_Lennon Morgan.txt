Hi Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent security breach that we experienced. As you know, our network was compromised by a malicious actor who was able to access sensitive data.

I'm writing to you specifically because your role as Network Administrator is critical to the security of our company. I need to know what steps you're taking to prevent a similar attack from happening again.

I understand that you're busy, but this is a top priority for me. I need to know that we're doing everything we can to protect our data.

Can you please send me a brief report on the steps you're taking to improve our security? I'd like to have this report by the end of the week.

Thanks,
Victor
