Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm excited to see what you and your team have come up with, and I'm confident that you'll knock it out of the park.

I know you're busy, but I wanted to see if you could spare a few minutes to chat about the campaign. I'm particularly interested in hearing about your plans for social media, and how you're going to reach our target audience.

I'm also curious to know what your budget is for the campaign. We have a certain amount of money that we can allocate, but I want to make sure that we're spending it wisely.

I'm available to meet with you at your convenience. Just let me know when works best for you.

Thanks,
Jade
