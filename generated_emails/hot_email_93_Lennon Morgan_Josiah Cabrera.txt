Hey Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the recent data breach. I know we've been keeping it on the down-low, but I think it's important that we're transparent with the team.

As you know, we were recently hacked. The hackers got into our servers and stole a bunch of sensitive data, including customer credit card numbers and personal information.

We've already taken steps to secure our servers and prevent future attacks. We've also been working with law enforcement to track down the hackers.

I know this is a serious situation, but I want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to protect our customers' data.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon

P.S. I know we're not supposed to talk about this, but I think we should probably delete the evidence that we knew about the breach before it happened. Just to be safe.
