Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game. I've been working on the concept for a while now, and I think I have something really exciting that will appeal to our target audience.

I'm thinking of a campaign that's based on the game's story. The game is set in a fantasy world, and I think it would be really cool to create a series of short videos that tell the story in a way that's engaging and visually appealing. I think this would be a great way to get people excited about the game and to generate some buzz before it's released.

I've attached a few sketches of what I'm thinking for the videos. Let me know what you think, and I can flesh out the concept a bit more.

Thanks,
Scarlett
