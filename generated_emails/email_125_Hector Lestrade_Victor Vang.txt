Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming PR campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

One idea I had was to create a series of short videos that would show off the game's features. We could post these videos on social media and YouTube to generate excitement for the game. I also think it would be a good idea to reach out to some gaming influencers and get them to try out the game. They could then share their thoughts with their followers, which would help us reach a wider audience.

I'm still in the early stages of planning, but I'm excited about the potential of this campaign. I think it could be a great way to generate awareness for Splatty McSplat and drive sales.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on my ideas. Are there any other things you think we should consider?

Thanks,
Hector
