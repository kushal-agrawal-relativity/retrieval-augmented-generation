Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "Splinter Cell: Blacklist." As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm reaching out to you because I'd like to get your input on the marketing campaign for the game. I know you've got a lot of experience in this area, and I think your insights would be invaluable.

I'm particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on how we can reach out to our core audience of gamers. What kind of messaging do you think will resonate with them? What kind of marketing channels do you think we should focus on?

I'd also love to hear your thoughts on the overall tone of the campaign. Do you think we should go for a more serious or lighthearted approach?

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to give me your thoughts on this. I'm available to chat by phone or email, whichever is more convenient for you.

Thanks,
Nikhil
