Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of creating a new internship program for Spintendo Gizzard. I think this would be a great way to attract top talent and get them involved in the gaming industry.

I've attached a proposal that outlines my vision for the program. I've also included some research on the benefits of internships for both companies and students.

I'd love to get your thoughts on this proposal and discuss it further. Please let me know if you're available for a meeting next week.

Thanks,
Scarlett
