Hi Damon,

I wanted to get your thoughts on the new character designs for the upcoming game. I think they're looking great, but I'm having a hard time deciding which one to use for the main character.

I'm leaning towards the one with the blue hair, but I'm not sure if it's too similar to the character design in our last game. What do you think?

Also, I have a few questions about the level design. I'm not sure how we're going to make the game challenging without making it too frustrating. Do you have any ideas?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
