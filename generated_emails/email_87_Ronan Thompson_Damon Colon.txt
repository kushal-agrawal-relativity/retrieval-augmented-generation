Hey Damon,

I wanted to get your thoughts on the new art style for the upcoming game. I think it's a great direction, but I'm worried that it might be too different from our previous games. What do you think?

Also, I'm wondering if you have any ideas for how we can improve the loading times. They're pretty long right now, and I think it's something we need to address.

Let me know what you think.
