Hi Damon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming art budget for the new game project. As you know, we're planning to create a new game that's set in a fantasy world. We're looking for a very detailed and realistic art style, so I think we're going to need to allocate a significant budget for art assets.

I've been doing some research, and I think we can get the best bang for our buck if we outsource the art to a third-party studio. I've already reached out to a few studios, and I'm waiting to hear back from them.

I'll keep you updated on the progress of this, and I'll let you know as soon as I have more information.

Thanks,
Jade
