Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty the Splatfish." I'm excited to report that we're on track for a launch date of March 8th, and I think we're going to have a real hit on our hands.

I've attached the latest marketing materials for your review. I think you'll be impressed with the creative direction we've taken with this game. We've also been working closely with our QA team to make sure that the game is polished and ready for release.

I'm confident that Splatty the Splatfish is going to be a huge success for Spintendo Gizzard. I'm looking forward to working with you to make this happen.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Ernie
