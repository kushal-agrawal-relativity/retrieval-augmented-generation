Hi Wilma,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of expanding our account management team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and I think it's time we added some more people to help manage our growing client base.

I've been doing some research, and I think I've found a few candidates who would be a great fit for our team. I'd like to set up some time to chat with you about them and get your feedback.

Would you be available to meet with me sometime this week?

Thanks,
Keenan
