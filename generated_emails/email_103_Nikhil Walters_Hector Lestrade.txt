Hey Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on the game's development for the past few months, and I'm really excited about it. I think it has the potential to be a huge hit, but we need to make sure that we market it effectively.

I've been doing some research on the target audience for the game, and I think we need to focus on reaching kids between the ages of 8 and 12. They're the most likely to be interested in the game, and they're also the most likely to spend money on in-game purchases.

I've come up with a few ideas for marketing campaigns that I think would be effective in reaching this target audience. I've attached a document with more details. I'd love to get your thoughts on these ideas, and I'm also open to suggestions.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Nikhil
