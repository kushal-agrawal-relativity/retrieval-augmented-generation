Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a critical campaign for us, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to reach our target audience.

I've been thinking about the best way to approach this, and I think that we need to focus on creating a strong social media presence. We need to make sure that we're engaging with our fans on a regular basis, and we need to be creating content that they'll find interesting and engaging.

I think that you're the perfect person to lead this effort. You have a great understanding of social media, and you're always up for coming up with new and creative ideas.

I'm going to put together a team of people to help you, and I'll be providing you with all the resources you need.

I'm really excited about this campaign, and I know that we can make it a success.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Jade
