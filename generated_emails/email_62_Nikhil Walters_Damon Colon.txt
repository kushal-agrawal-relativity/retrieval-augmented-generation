Hi Damon,

I'm writing to you to discuss the upcoming art assets for our new game. I'm really excited about the direction you're taking with the character designs, but I have a few concerns about the level of detail.

I think we need to make sure that the assets are scalable for different platforms. We don't want to have to create a whole new set of assets for each platform, so it's important to make sure that they're high-quality enough to be used on any device.

I'd also like to talk about the color palette. I think we need to make sure that the colors are consistent across all of the assets. This will help to create a cohesive look and feel for the game.

I'm available to chat with you about this whenever you're free. Just let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Nikhil
