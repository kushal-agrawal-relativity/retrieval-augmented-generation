Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on the budget, and I think we need to increase it by 10%.

I know that we're already on a tight budget, but I think this is a necessary investment. Splatty McSplat is our most ambitious game yet, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to market it effectively.

I've been doing some research, and I think that a 10% increase in our budget would allow us to do a few things that would really make a difference. First, we could hire a more experienced marketing agency. This would give us access to the expertise and resources that we need to create a really successful campaign.

Second, we could increase our advertising spend. This would allow us to reach a wider audience and generate more buzz for the game.

Finally, we could invest in some creative marketing initiatives. This could include things like creating a viral video, running a contest, or partnering with a popular influencer.

I know that this is a lot to ask, but I think it's worth it. Splatty McSplat is our chance to make a real impact on the gaming industry, and I'm confident that we can do it if we give ourselves the resources we need.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Jade
