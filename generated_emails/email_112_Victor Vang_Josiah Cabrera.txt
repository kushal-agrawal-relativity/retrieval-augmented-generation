Hi Josiah,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we get the marketing right.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can reach our target audience. We've already got a few ideas, but I'd love to hear your input.

Do you have any thoughts on how we can best market Splatty McSplat? Are there any specific channels or demographics that we should focus on?

I'm also open to any other ideas you have for the campaign.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Victor
