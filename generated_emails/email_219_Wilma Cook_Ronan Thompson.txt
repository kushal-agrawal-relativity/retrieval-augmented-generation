Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is our most ambitious project to date, and we're all really excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the work you've been doing on the game's physics engine. The way you've implemented the ragdoll physics is really impressive, and I think it's going to make the game a lot more fun to play.

I'm also really happy with the work you've done on the AI. The enemies in the game are really challenging, and I think they're going to keep players on their toes.

I know you've been working hard on this project, and I really appreciate all your hard work. I'm confident that Splatty McSplat is going to be a huge success, and I'm excited to see it released to the public.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,
Wilma
