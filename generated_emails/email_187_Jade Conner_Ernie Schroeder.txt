Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McBlot. I've been working with the marketing team to come up with a plan, and I wanted to get your thoughts before we move forward.

We're planning to launch a big social media campaign, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We'll be creating a series of short, funny videos that showcase the game's unique features. We'll also be running paid ads on both platforms.

In addition to social media, we're also planning to run a paid search campaign on Google. We'll be targeting people who are searching for terms related to our game, such as "puzzle games" and "action games."

I'm confident that this campaign will be a success. We've got a great team working on it, and we're using the most effective marketing channels.

I'd love to get your feedback on the plan. Do you have any suggestions for how we can improve it?

Thanks,
Jade
