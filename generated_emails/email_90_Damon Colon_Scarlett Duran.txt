Hey Scarlett,

I've been working on some new concept art for the next level of our game, and I wanted to get your thoughts on it. I think it's really coming together, but I'd love to hear your feedback before I move on to the next stage.

Can you take a look at it and let me know what you think? I'll be in my office all day, so just come by whenever you have a chance.

Thanks,
Damon
