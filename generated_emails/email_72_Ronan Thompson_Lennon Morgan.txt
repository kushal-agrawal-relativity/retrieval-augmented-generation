Hey Lennon,

I'm writing to you about the recent network outages we've been experiencing. I'm concerned that these outages are affecting our ability to deliver our games on time and to our customers' satisfaction.

I'd like to schedule a time to chat with you about the root cause of these outages and what we can do to prevent them from happening again. Can you make yourself available for a meeting next week?

Thanks,
Ronan
