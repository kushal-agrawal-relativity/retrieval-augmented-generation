Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." I'm excited to report that we're on track for a successful launch, and I'm confident that the game will be a hit with players.

I've attached a copy of the launch plan for your review. As you can see, we've got a lot of exciting things planned for the launch, including a social media campaign, a pre-order bonus, and a launch event in New York City.

I'm also working on a press release for the launch, and I'll be sending that to you for your approval soon.

I'm looking forward to working with you to make the launch of "Splatty's Adventure" a success!

Best,
Ernie
