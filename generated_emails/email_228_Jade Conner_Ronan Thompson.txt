Hi Ronan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty McSplat." I'm excited to announce that you've been promoted to the position of Senior Software Engineer in recognition of your hard work and dedication to the project.

As Senior Software Engineer, you'll be responsible for leading a team of engineers in the development of future games. You'll also be responsible for working closely with the design team to ensure that our games meet the needs of our customers.

I know you're up for the challenge, and I'm confident that you'll continue to be a valuable asset to our team.

Congratulations!

Jade
