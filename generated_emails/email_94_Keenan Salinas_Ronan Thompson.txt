Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splatty's Adventure."

As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to promote it. I think that we could really benefit from working with a marketing agency to help us develop and execute our campaign.

I've done some research, and I've found a few agencies that I think would be a good fit for us. I'd love to set up a time to chat with you about them and get your thoughts.

Let me know if you're free this week.

Thanks,
Keenan
