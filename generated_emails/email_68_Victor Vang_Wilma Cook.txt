Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of layoffs. As you know, we've been facing some tough financial challenges lately, and we've had to make some difficult decisions about how to cut costs.

I know that this is a difficult time for everyone involved, and I want to thank you for your understanding and support. I promise that we're doing everything we can to make this process as smooth as possible.

I've attached a list of the employees who will be affected by the layoffs. I've also included a severance package that we're offering to each employee.

I know that this is a lot to take in, but I'm here to answer any questions you may have. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need anything.

Sincerely,
Victor
