Hi Wilma,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of expanding our marketing team. As you know, we've been seeing a lot of growth in recent months, and I think it's time we start investing in our marketing efforts to keep up with the demand.

I've been doing some research, and I think we could really benefit from hiring a social media manager and a content writer. A social media manager would be responsible for managing our social media accounts and creating engaging content, while a content writer would be responsible for writing blog posts, articles, and other marketing materials.

I think these two positions would be a great addition to our team, and they would help us reach a wider audience and grow our business. I've attached a budget and a job description for each position, so you can take a look and let me know what you think.

I'm available to discuss this further at your convenience. Thanks for your time.

Best,
Jade
