Hey Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game, Splatty McBlot. I've been working with Josiah Cabrera, our Head of Marketing, and we've come up with a few ideas that we think you'll like.

We're thinking of doing a social media campaign that focuses on user-generated content. We'd like to encourage players to share videos and screenshots of their best moments in the game. We think this would be a great way to get people excited about the game and to generate some buzz.

We're also considering doing a paid advertising campaign on YouTube and Twitch. We think this would be a good way to reach people who are already interested in video games.

We'd love to get your thoughts on these ideas. Let us know if you have any other suggestions.

Thanks,
Keenan
