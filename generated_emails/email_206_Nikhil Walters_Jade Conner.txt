Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and I wanted to get your thoughts on the marketing plan.

I'm particularly concerned about the budget. We're planning to spend a lot of money on advertising, and I want to make sure that we're getting the best bang for our buck.

Do you have any thoughts on how we can optimize our marketing spend? Are there any specific channels or strategies that you think we should focus on?

I'd also love to hear your thoughts on the overall marketing message. What do you think will resonate with our target audience?

Any feedback you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Nikhil
