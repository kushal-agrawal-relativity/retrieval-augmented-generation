Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." As you know, this is our most ambitious project to date, and we're all really excited about it.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the game's marketing strategy. We've already got a few ideas in the works, but I'd love to hear your input. Do you have any suggestions for how we can reach a wider audience and generate excitement for the game?

I'm also curious to hear your thoughts on the game's pricing. We're still undecided on whether to make it a free-to-play game or to charge a set price. What do you think would be the best option for our target audience?

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take some time to think about these questions and get back to me with your thoughts.

Thanks,
Wilma
