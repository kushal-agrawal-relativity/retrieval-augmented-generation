Hi Damon,

I'm reaching out to you about the new character designs for the upcoming game. I'm really digging the direction you're going with them, but I have a few suggestions that I think could make them even better.

First, I think the characters could use a bit more personality. They all look very similar right now, and it's hard to tell them apart. I would suggest adding some more distinctive features to each character, such as different hairstyles, clothing, or accessories.

Second, I think the characters could be more expressive. Right now, they all have very neutral expressions, which makes them seem a bit lifeless. I would suggest adding some more emotion to their faces, such as smiles, frowns, or raised eyebrows.

Finally, I think the characters could be more dynamic. They all seem to be standing in the same pose, which makes them look a bit static. I would suggest having them in different poses, such as running, jumping, or fighting.

I know you're a talented artist, and I'm confident that you can take these suggestions and make the characters even better. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ernie
