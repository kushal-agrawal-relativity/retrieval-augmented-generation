Hi Damon,

I'm writing to you about the new art direction for our upcoming game. I've been working with Ronan and Scarlett on the design, and we're really excited about the direction we're headed in.

I wanted to get your thoughts on the new concept art. We're thinking of going with a more stylized look, with a focus on bright colors and bold shapes. Do you think this would be a good fit for our game?

I'm also open to other ideas, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

We're on a tight deadline, so we need to make a decision soon. Can you get back to me by the end of the week?

Thanks,
Nikhil
