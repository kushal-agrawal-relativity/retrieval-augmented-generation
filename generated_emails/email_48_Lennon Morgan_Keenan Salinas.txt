Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you because I'm having some trouble with the new firewall configuration. I've tried everything I can think of, but I can't seem to get it working properly.

I'm wondering if you could take a look at it and see if you can spot the problem. I'm available anytime tomorrow if you'd like to come by my office.

Thanks,
Lennon
