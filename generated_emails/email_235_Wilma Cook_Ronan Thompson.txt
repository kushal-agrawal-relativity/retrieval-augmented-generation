Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty McSplat." As you know, this is a major release for our company, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about your work on the game's software engineering. You've done a fantastic job, and I'm confident that the game will be a huge success thanks to your hard work.

I wanted to reach out and thank you for your contributions to the team. You're a valuable asset to Spintendo Gizzard, and I'm proud to have you as a member of our team.

I'm looking forward to working with you on future projects.

Best,
Wilma
