Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McBlot. I've been working with the team on the creative direction, and I think we've come up with something really exciting.

I'd love to get your thoughts on the campaign before we move forward. Do you have time to chat this week?

Best,
Hector
