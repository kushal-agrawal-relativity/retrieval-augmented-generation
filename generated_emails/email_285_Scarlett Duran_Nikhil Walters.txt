Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the new game design that I'm working on. I'm thinking of calling it "Super Mario Bros. 2".

I've been working on the concept for a while now, and I think it's really starting to come together. I'm particularly excited about the new power-up that I've come up with. It's called the "Fire Flower", and it allows Mario to shoot fireballs.

I'm still working out the details, but I think this could be a really big addition to the game. I'm hoping to have a prototype ready for you to see by the end of the week.

Let me know what you think!

Scarlett
