Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to you because I'm having some trouble with the new UI design for our upcoming game. I think the colors are too bright and the overall layout is a bit cluttered.

Could you take a look and see if you can make some adjustments? I'm thinking we should tone down the colors and maybe add some more white space.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
