Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the progress of our new game engine. As you know, we've been working on this for a few months now, and I'm happy to report that we're making great progress.

I've attached a progress report that outlines all of the work we've done so far. As you can see, we've made significant progress in all areas. We've completed the design phase, and we're now in the process of implementing the code.

I'm confident that we're on track to release the new game engine on time and within budget. I'll keep you updated on our progress, and I'll let you know as soon as we're ready to launch.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Nikhil
