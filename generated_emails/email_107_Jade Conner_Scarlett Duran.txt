Hi Scarlett,

Hope you're doing well! I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splinter Cell: Blacklist." As you know, this is a major release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the game's design. I think you did a great job of creating a challenging and engaging experience for players, and I'm curious to hear what you think about the final product.

I'd also like to get your feedback on our marketing plan for the game. We're working on a number of different initiatives, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on how we can best reach our target audience.

I'm available to chat anytime this week. Please let me know if you're interested in meeting up.

Thanks,
Jade
