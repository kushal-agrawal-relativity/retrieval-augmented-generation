Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splinter Cell: Blacklist." As you know, this is a critical project for the company, and we need to make sure that we do everything we can to get it right.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the target audience for this game. Who do you think we should be marketing to? What are their needs and wants? What kind of messaging will resonate with them?

I'd love to get your thoughts on this as soon as possible. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jade
