Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming sales figures for the new game, "Splatty McSplat." As you know, this is a critical product for us, and we need to make sure that we're on track to meet our sales goals.

I've been looking over the data, and I'm concerned that we're not going to hit our targets. Our sales are currently lagging behind where they were at this point last year.

I'm wondering if you have any ideas about how we can close the gap. Do you think we need to do more marketing? Are there any other factors that could be affecting our sales?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. We need to come up with a plan to turn things around, and I think you have some valuable insights that could help us.

Thanks,
Jade
