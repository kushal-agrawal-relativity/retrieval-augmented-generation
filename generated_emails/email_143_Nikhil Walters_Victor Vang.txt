Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of hiring a new HR manager. As you know, our current HR manager is retiring at the end of the month, and we need to find a replacement as soon as possible.

I've been doing some research, and I've found a few candidates who I think would be a good fit for our company. I'd like to set up a time to meet with you so we can discuss them further.

Are you available for a meeting next week?

Thanks,
Nikhil
