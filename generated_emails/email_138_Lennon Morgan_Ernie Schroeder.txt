Hey Ernie,

I wanted to check in about the status of the new networking infrastructure. I know you're working on it with Ronan, and I'm just curious to know when you think it'll be ready to go live.

We're starting to get a little bit backed up on our orders, and we think the new infrastructure could help us to speed things up a bit.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Lennon
