Hi Wilma,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splodey Bob." I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we could focus on the game's unique selling point: it's the first game that allows players to create their own levels. I think this could be a big draw for gamers, and it would set us apart from other games in the genre.

I'm also thinking that we could use some social media influencers to promote the game. I've been doing some research, and I think we could get some really good results by working with the right people.

I'm still in the early stages of planning, but I wanted to get your thoughts before I move forward. What do you think about my ideas? Do you have any suggestions of your own?

I'm available to chat anytime this week if you'd like to discuss this further. Just let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Josiah
