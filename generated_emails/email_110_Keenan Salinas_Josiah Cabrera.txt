Hey Josiah,

Hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to see if you have any availability this week to chat about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game. I've got a few ideas I'd like to run by you and get your thoughts.

Would you be free to hop on a call sometime this week? I'm available on Tuesday and Wednesday after 3pm, and Thursday and Friday after 1pm.

Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Keenan
