Dear Keenan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game, Splatty McBlot. I've been working on some ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I think we should focus on the game's unique selling point: it's a platform shooter where you can play as any character from our other games. This is a big departure from the usual platform shooters, and I think it's something that will really appeal to gamers.

I'm thinking we could create a series of short videos featuring different characters from our games. Each video would show off the character's unique abilities and how they can be used in Splatty McBlot. We could also create some social media posts and ads that highlight the same thing.

I'm open to other ideas, so please let me know what you think. I'm really excited about this campaign, and I think it has the potential to be a big success.

Thanks,
Scarlett
