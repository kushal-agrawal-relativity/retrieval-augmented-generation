Hi Hector,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can best leverage our social media presence to reach our target audience.

As you know, Splatty McSplat is a physics-based puzzle game that's all about stacking blocks to create the highest tower possible. The game is designed for a casual audience, so we're looking for ways to reach people who are looking for a fun and challenging game to play.

I think our social media channels could be a great way to reach this audience. We can post videos of gameplay, share tips and tricks, and run contests and giveaways. We can also partner with influencers who can help us spread the word about the game.

I'm open to any and all ideas you have on how we can use social media to promote Splatty McSplat. I'm also happy to set up a time to chat with you in person if you'd like.

Thanks,
Josiah
