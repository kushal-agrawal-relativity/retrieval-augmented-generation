Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming round of layoffs. I know this is a difficult time for everyone involved, but I wanted to reassure you that we're doing everything we can to support our employees through this transition.

We've already started working with a severance package and outplacement services, and we're providing counseling and support to those who are affected. We're also committed to providing opportunities for our employees to transition to new roles within the company, or to find new jobs outside of Spintendo Gizzard.

I know that you have a lot of questions, and I'm happy to answer them as best I can. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need anything.

Thanks,
Jade
