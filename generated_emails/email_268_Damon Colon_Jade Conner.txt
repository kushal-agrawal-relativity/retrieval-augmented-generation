Hi Jade,

I wanted to run an idea by you for the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game. I was thinking that we could do a cross-promotion with another company in the gaming industry. It would be a great way to reach a new audience and get people excited about our game.

I've been doing some research, and I think it would be a good fit to partner with [Company Name]. They have a similar target audience to ours, and they're always looking for new ways to promote their games.

I've put together a proposal that outlines the details of the partnership. I'd love to get your thoughts on it and see if you think it's something we should pursue.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Damon
