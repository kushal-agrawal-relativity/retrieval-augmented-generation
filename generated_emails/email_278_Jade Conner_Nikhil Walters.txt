Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming financial projections for the next quarter. I've been working on them with Ronan, and we're almost finished. I wanted to run them by you before we finalize them, just to make sure we're on the same page.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. The projections are looking good overall. We're on track to meet our revenue goals, and we're seeing some promising signs in terms of user growth.

There are a few areas where we could see some challenges. First, we're going to need to increase our marketing spend in order to keep up with the growth of our competitors. Second, we're going to need to make some changes to our pricing structure in order to stay competitive.

I've attached the full projections to this email. Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions. I'm available to chat later this week if you'd like to discuss them in more detail.

Thanks,
Jade
