Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in DDoS attacks on our servers. As you know, these attacks have been causing a lot of problems for our customers, and we need to find a way to mitigate them.

I've been doing some research, and I think I've come up with a solution. I'm proposing that we invest in a new DDoS mitigation service. This service would essentially act as a buffer between our servers and the outside world, and it would help to protect us from these attacks.

I've attached a proposal that outlines my plan in more detail. I'd love to get your thoughts on it and see if you think it's something we should pursue.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Keenan
