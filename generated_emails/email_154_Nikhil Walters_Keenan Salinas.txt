Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure its success.

I'm particularly concerned about our marketing strategy. I think we need to do a better job of reaching out to potential customers and getting them excited about the game. Do you have any ideas on how we can improve our marketing efforts?

I'm also worried about our sales team. I think they need to be more aggressive in closing deals. Can you talk to them and see what we can do to improve their performance?

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at these issues and come up with some suggestions. We need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make Splatty McSplat a success.

Thanks,
Nikhil
