Hey Ronan,

I'm writing to you about the recent network outage. I've been looking into the issue, and I think I've found the source of the problem.

It looks like there was a problem with the DNS server. I've already made a few changes, and I think it should be fixed now. I'm going to keep an eye on it, and I'll let you know if anything changes.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon
