Hi Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splodey McBlasty." I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we could do a big social media push, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We could create some fun and engaging content that would get people excited about the game. We could also run some paid ads to target specific demographics.

I'm also thinking that we could do some offline marketing, like print ads and posters. This would help to reach people who aren't on social media.

I'm open to other ideas, too. What do you think?

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Josiah
