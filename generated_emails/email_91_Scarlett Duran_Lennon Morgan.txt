Hi Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." As you know, we're planning to launch the game on a variety of platforms, including PC, consoles, and mobile devices.

I'm concerned about the security of our network, and I'm wondering if you could take a look at it and make sure that it's up to snuff. I'm particularly worried about the possibility of DDoS attacks, as well as other forms of malicious activity.

I know that you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at this for me. We need to make sure that our network is secure before we launch the game, or we could be in for a lot of trouble.

Thanks,
Scarlett
