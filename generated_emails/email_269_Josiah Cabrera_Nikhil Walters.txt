Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that show off the game's features. We could post these videos on social media and YouTube to generate excitement and buzz.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or Twitch streamer to play the game and give their thoughts on it. This would be a great way to reach a wider audience and get people interested in the game.

I'm also considering running a contest or giveaway to promote the game. This could be a good way to generate excitement and get people talking about the game.

I'm open to other ideas as well. What do you think about these? Do you have any other suggestions?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Josiah
