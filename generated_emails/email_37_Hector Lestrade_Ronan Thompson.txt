Hey Ronan,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to see if you'd be interested in doing a guest blog post for our website. We're always looking for ways to get more insights from our team members, and I think your experience as a lead software engineer would be really valuable to our readers.

The post would be about your journey to becoming a lead software engineer, and what advice you have for other aspiring engineers. We'd also love to hear about your work on some of our recent projects.

If you're interested, let me know and I can send you more details about the post. We'd love to have you on board!

Best,
Hector
