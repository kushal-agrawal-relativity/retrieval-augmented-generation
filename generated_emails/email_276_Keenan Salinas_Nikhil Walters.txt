Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McBlot. I've been working with Josiah Cabrera, our Head of Marketing, to come up with a plan, and we'd love to get your input before we move forward.

We're thinking of doing a big social media push, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We'll be creating some fun and engaging content that will appeal to our target audience of young adults. We'll also be running some paid ads to reach a wider audience.

We're also planning to do some offline marketing, such as print ads and posters. We'll be targeting specific locations where our target audience is likely to be, such as college campuses and gaming conventions.

We're really excited about this campaign, and we think it has the potential to be a big success. We'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback, so please let us know if you have any suggestions.

Thanks,
Keenan
