Hi Ernie,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming product launch of our new game, "Splatty McBlotch." As you know, this is a major project for our company, and we need to make sure that it's a success.

I'm particularly concerned about the marketing campaign for this game. We need to make sure that we reach our target audience and generate enough excitement to drive sales.

I'd like to work with you to develop a marketing plan that will achieve our goals. I think your experience in this area would be invaluable.

Could you come to my office at your earliest convenience to discuss this further?

Thanks,
Victor
