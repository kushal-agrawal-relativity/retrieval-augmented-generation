Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you with an update on the new game design. We've been working on it for a few weeks now, and I think we're finally starting to get somewhere.

I've attached a few concept art sketches for you to take a look at. I think they give a good idea of the direction we're heading in.

I'm also working on a prototype of the game engine. I'm hoping to have that finished by the end of the week.

I'll keep you updated on our progress. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Scarlett
