Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the new character designs for the upcoming game. I've got a few ideas that I'd like to run by you and get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we should go for a more stylized look this time around. Something that's a little more fun and whimsical. I think it would be a good fit for the game's overall tone.

I've attached a few sketches that I've been working on. Let me know what you think.

I'm also open to any other ideas you might have. We can brainstorm together and come up with something that we're both happy with.

Thanks,
Damon
