Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming financial projections. I know you're busy, but I'd really appreciate it if you could take a look at them and give me your feedback by the end of the week.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the following:

* The projected growth rate for the next fiscal year
* The impact of the new marketing campaign on our bottom line
* The feasibility of our new product development roadmap

I know you're a busy person, so I really appreciate your time. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Wilma
