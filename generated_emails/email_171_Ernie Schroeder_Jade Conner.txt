Hi Jade,

I wanted to touch base with you about the new product roadmap. I've been working on some ideas for new features that I think would be really beneficial to our customers, and I wanted to get your feedback before I put together a more formal proposal.

I'm thinking of adding a new social media integration feature that would allow users to share their progress on our games with their friends. I think this would be a great way to increase engagement and grow our user base.

I'm also considering adding a new level editor so that users can create their own levels and share them with other players. This would be a great way to keep our users engaged and coming back for more.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these ideas. Do you think they're feasible? Do you have any other ideas that you think would be better?

Let me know what you think, and I can start putting together a more formal proposal.

Thanks,
Ernie
