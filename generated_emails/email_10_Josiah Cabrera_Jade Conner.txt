Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. As you know, this is our most ambitious project to date, and we need to make sure that we get the marketing right.

I've been working on a few ideas, and I'm excited to share them with you. I think we should focus on creating a strong social media presence for the game, and I've already started working on a plan to do that. I'm also thinking about reaching out to some influencers to get them to play the game and share their thoughts with their followers.

I'd love to get your feedback on these ideas, and I'm also open to hearing any other suggestions you might have. We need to make sure that we're on the same page before we start spending any money on marketing, so let's chat soon.

Thanks,
Josiah
