Hi Hector,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming company retreat. As you know, we're planning to take a few days off in January to relax and bond as a team.

I'm working on the itinerary, and I wanted to get your input on a few things.

First, I'm thinking of having the retreat at a ski resort in Colorado. Do you think that would be a good location?

Second, I'm trying to decide what activities we should do during the retreat. I was thinking of having some team-building exercises, as well as some time for skiing and snowboarding.

Finally, I'm wondering how much we should budget for the retreat. I'm thinking of keeping it under $10,000, but I'm open to suggestions.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these things. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Victor
