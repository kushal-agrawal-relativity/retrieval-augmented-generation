Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of adding a new account manager to our team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and our current account managers are starting to get stretched thin. I think adding a new person would help us to provide better service to our clients and continue to grow our business.

I've been doing some research, and I think I've found a few candidates who would be a good fit for our team. I'd like to set up some time to chat with you about them and get your feedback. Are you free this week for a meeting?

Thanks,
Keenan
