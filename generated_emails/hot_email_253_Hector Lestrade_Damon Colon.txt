Hey Damon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent leak of our upcoming game's concept art. As you know, this is a very sensitive matter, and we need to be careful about how we handle it.

I've been doing some digging, and I think I've found the source of the leak. It looks like someone from our art department sent the concept art to a friend who then posted it online. I'm not sure who exactly did it, but I'm confident that we'll be able to figure it out.

In the meantime, I'm asking you to please keep this matter confidential. We don't want to create a panic among our investors or customers. I'm also asking you to cooperate with our investigation. We need to find out who leaked the concept art and make sure that this doesn't happen again.

I know that this is a lot to ask, but it's important that we protect our company's interests. I appreciate your understanding.

Sincerely,
Hector Lestrade
