Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I'm hoping you can provide some insights into how we can best reach our target audience.

As you know, Splatty's Adventure is a 3D platformer aimed at kids ages 6-12. We're hoping to create a campaign that will appeal to both kids and parents.

I've been doing some research, and it looks like kids are most likely to be influenced by their parents when it comes to making purchasing decisions. So I think it's important that we focus on creating marketing materials that will appeal to both kids and parents.

I'm also thinking that we should focus on creating a sense of urgency. We want kids to feel like they need to have Splatty's Adventure right away.

What do you think? Do you have any ideas for how we can best reach our target audience?

Thanks,
Jade
