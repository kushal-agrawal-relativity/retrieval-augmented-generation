Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a major milestone for our company, and I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

I'm particularly excited about the work that you've been doing with our account managers to secure pre-orders. Your team has been instrumental in getting the word out about Splatty McSplat, and I'm grateful for your hard work.

I know that you're also working on a number of other projects, but I'd like to ask you to focus your attention on Splatty McSplat in the coming weeks. This is going to be a critical time for the game, and I need to know that we have the best possible team in place to make sure it's a success.

I'm confident that you'll rise to the challenge, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you can accomplish.

Thanks,
Wilma
