Dear Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent network outages we've been experiencing. As you know, these outages have been causing a lot of problems for our employees and customers.

I've been working with our team to investigate the issue, and we believe we've identified the root cause. The problem is with a new software update that we recently installed. The update has been causing a conflict with our existing network infrastructure.

We're working on a fix for this issue, and we expect to have it resolved by the end of the week. In the meantime, I'm asking that you please be patient with our employees and customers. We're doing everything we can to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Lennon
