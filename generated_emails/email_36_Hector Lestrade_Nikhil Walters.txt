Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

One idea I had was to create a series of short, funny videos that would introduce the game and its characters. I think this would be a great way to reach a wider audience and get people excited about the game.

I also had the idea of running a contest on social media, where people could submit their own videos of them playing Splatty's Adventure. The winner would get a prize, and we could use the videos to promote the game.

I'm still working out the details, but I think these are some great ways to market Splatty's Adventure. I'd love to hear your thoughts, and I'm happy to work with you to develop a plan that we're both happy with.

Thanks,
Hector
