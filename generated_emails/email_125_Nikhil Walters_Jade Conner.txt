Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty McSplatface." As you know, this is our most ambitious project to date, and we're all really excited about it.

I'm reaching out to you because I need your help with the marketing campaign. I know you're busy with your CFO duties, but I think your expertise in this area would be invaluable.

I'm specifically looking for your help with developing a strategy to reach our target audience. We need to make sure that people know about our game and are excited to play it.

I'm also hoping you can help us with the budget for the marketing campaign. We need to make sure that we're spending our money wisely and getting the most bang for our buck.

I know you're a busy person, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at this and let me know what you think. I'm available to chat anytime this week if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Nikhil
