Hi Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." As you know, this is a big release for us, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the work that you've done on the account management side. You've really knocked it out of the park, and I'm confident that you're going to help us make this game a huge success.

I wanted to reach out and thank you for all your hard work. You're a valuable member of our team, and I'm grateful for your contributions.

I'm looking forward to working with you on this project, and I'm confident that we're going to make something really special.

Best,
Ernie
