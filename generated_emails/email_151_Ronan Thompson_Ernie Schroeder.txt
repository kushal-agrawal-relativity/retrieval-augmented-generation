Subject: New feature proposal for the upcoming game

Hey Ernie,

I'm writing to you today to propose a new feature for the upcoming game. I think this feature would be a great addition, and it would make the game more fun and engaging for players.

The feature I'm proposing is a new type of enemy that players can encounter. These enemies would be more challenging than the current enemies, and they would require players to use different strategies to defeat them. I think this would add a new level of difficulty to the game, and it would make it more rewarding for players who are able to defeat the enemies.

I've attached a design document that outlines the new enemy type in more detail. I'd love to get your thoughts on the proposal, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

Thanks,
Ronan
