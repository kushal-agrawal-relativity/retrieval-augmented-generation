Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we get the marketing right.

I'm thinking that we should focus on two key areas:

* **Reaching a wider audience.** We need to make sure that people who aren't already familiar with Spintendo Gizzard are aware of Splatty's Adventure. We can do this by advertising on social media, running ads in gaming magazines, and reaching out to influencers.
* **Creating a sense of excitement.** We need to make people excited about playing Splatty's Adventure. We can do this by creating engaging trailers and screenshots, and by running contests and giveaways.

I'm confident that we can create a successful marketing campaign for Splatty's Adventure. I'm looking forward to working with you on this project.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Hector
