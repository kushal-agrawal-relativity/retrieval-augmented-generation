Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to you because I'm working on a new marketing campaign for our upcoming game, and I wanted to get your input on the art direction. I'm particularly interested in seeing what you think about the concept art we've been working on.

Would you be able to take a look at it and let me know what you think? I'm available for a meeting tomorrow at 10am if you're free.

Thanks,
Josiah
