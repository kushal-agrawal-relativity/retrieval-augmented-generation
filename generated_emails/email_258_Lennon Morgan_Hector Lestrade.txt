Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the recent DDoS attack that took down our servers. I've been working with our security team to investigate the attack and identify the source.

So far, we've been able to determine that the attack was launched from a botnet of compromised devices. The attackers used a variety of techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and brute force attacks.

We're still working to patch the vulnerabilities that were exploited, but we've already taken steps to improve our security posture. We've implemented a new firewall, updated our security software, and increased our monitoring capabilities.

I'm confident that these measures will help to protect us from future attacks. However, I'd like to discuss with you the possibility of implementing a more comprehensive security solution. I think this would give us the best possible protection against future attacks.

I'm available to meet with you at your convenience to discuss this further. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Lennon
