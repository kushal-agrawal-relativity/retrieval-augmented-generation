Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, "Splodey Buddies." As you know, I'm the lead account manager for this project, and I'm responsible for managing the relationships with our marketing and sales partners.

I'm reaching out to you because I'm looking for your input on the marketing plan for the game. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the following:

* The target audience for the game
* The key messages that we should be communicating to our audience
* The best ways to reach our target audience

I would really appreciate it if you could take some time to give me your feedback on these questions. I'm available to meet with you at your convenience.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best,
Keenan
