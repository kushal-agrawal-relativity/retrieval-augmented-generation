Keenan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big project for us, and we need to make sure that we get the marketing right.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can reach our target audience. We've already done some research, and we know that our target audience is mostly young adults who are interested in action games. But we need to find a way to reach them in a way that's both engaging and effective.

I'm open to any ideas you have, so please let me know if you come up with anything.

Thanks,
Hector
