Hey Jade,

I'm reaching out to see if you'd be interested in doing a guest blog post for our company website. We're looking for some fresh perspectives on the gaming industry, and I think your insights as CFO would be really valuable to our readers.

I'm imagining a post that's about 500-700 words long, and that covers topics like your role in the gaming industry, your thoughts on the future of gaming, and any advice you have for aspiring game developers.

If you're interested, let me know and I can send you a more detailed outline. We'd love to have you on board!

Thanks,
Hector
