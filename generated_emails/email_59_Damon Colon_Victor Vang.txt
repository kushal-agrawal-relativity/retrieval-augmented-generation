Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming art contest for our new game. I'm looking for your help in promoting the contest and getting as many people as possible to participate.

The contest is open to all employees of Spintendo Gizzard, and the winner will receive a $1,000 prize. The deadline for submissions is February 28th, so we need to get the word out soon.

I think this is a great opportunity to showcase the talent of our artists, and I'm confident that it will generate a lot of excitement for the new game.

Would you be able to send out a company-wide email about the contest? I can provide you with the text and images that you need.

I'm also planning to post about the contest on our social media channels, but I could use your help in getting people to share and retweet our posts.

Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Damon
