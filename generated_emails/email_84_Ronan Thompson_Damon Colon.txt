Hey Damon,

I'm writing to you about the new level design for the upcoming game. I think we need to make some changes to the way the player interacts with the environment.

I think it would be more immersive if the player could actually interact with the objects in the level. For example, they could pick up and throw objects, or use them to solve puzzles. This would make the game more challenging and fun.

I've attached a few sketches that show what I'm thinking. Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ronan
