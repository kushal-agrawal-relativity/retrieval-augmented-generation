Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that show off the game's features. We could post them on social media and YouTube to generate excitement and buzz. Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer to do a gameplay video. This could help us reach a new audience of potential players.

I'm open to other ideas as well. What do you think would be the most effective way to market Splatty McSplat?

Let me know what you think,
Nikhil
