Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming game design competition. As you know, we're looking for new and innovative ideas for our next game. The competition is open to all employees, and the winner will receive a cash prize and a chance to have their game concept developed into a full-fledged game.

I'm excited to see what you come up with. We're always looking for ways to improve our games, and I think your creativity and expertise could be a valuable asset to the team.

The competition deadline is two weeks from today, so please get started as soon as possible. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks,
Victor
