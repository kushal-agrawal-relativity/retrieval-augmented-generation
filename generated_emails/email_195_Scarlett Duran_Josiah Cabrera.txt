Hey Josiah,

I'm reaching out to you about the new marketing campaign we're working on. I'm having some trouble coming up with a catchy slogan, and I was wondering if you had any ideas.

I'm thinking something along the lines of "Spintendo Gizzard: Play the Best Games!" but I'm not sure if that's too generic. Do you have any other suggestions?

I'm also wondering if you could give me some feedback on the overall concept of the campaign. I'm thinking we should focus on promoting our new game, "Splatty McSplatface," but I'm open to other ideas.

Let me know what you think!

Scarlett
