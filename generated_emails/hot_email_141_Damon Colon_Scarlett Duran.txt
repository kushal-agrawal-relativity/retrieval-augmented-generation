Hey Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "The Secret of Spintendo Gizzard." As you know, this is our most ambitious project to date, and we're all really excited about it.

I'm concerned, however, about the legal implications of the game's storyline. As you know, the game is set in a fictional world where magic is real and dragons exist. However, we're worried that some players might not realize that the game is not based on real history.

I'm specifically concerned about the scene where the protagonist, a young wizard, uses a magic spell to summon a dragon. We're worried that some players might think that this is an accurate depiction of how magic works, and that they might try to summon their own dragons.

I know that this is a small concern, but I think it's important to be aware of. I'm open to any suggestions you might have on how to address this issue.

Thanks,
Damon
