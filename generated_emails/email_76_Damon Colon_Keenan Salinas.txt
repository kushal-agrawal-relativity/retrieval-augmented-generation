Hey Keenan,

I've got some ideas for a new marketing campaign that I wanted to run by you. I think it could really help us reach a wider audience and generate more leads.

I'm thinking we could do a series of short, funny videos that showcase our games in a fun and engaging way. We could post them on social media and YouTube, and then drive traffic back to our website.

I think this would be a great way to show off our games and get people excited about them. Plus, it would be a lot more cost-effective than traditional advertising.

What do you think? Let me know if you have any ideas or feedback.

Damon
