Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of expanding our account management team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and I think it's time we add some more people to help manage our growing client base.

I've been doing some research, and I think we could really benefit from hiring a couple of account managers with experience in the gaming industry. These people would be responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with our existing clients, as well as identifying and pursuing new opportunities.

I've attached a job description that outlines the specific skills and qualifications we're looking for. I'd love to get your thoughts on this, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

Thanks,
Keenan
