Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working with the team on the creative direction, and I think we've come up with a really strong concept.

I'm attaching the campaign brief for your review. I'd love to get your thoughts on it as soon as possible so we can start putting the plan into action.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Victor
