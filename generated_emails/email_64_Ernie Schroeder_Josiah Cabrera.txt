Hi Josiah,

I'm reaching out to you about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I've been working on the concept for a while now, and I think I've come up with something really great.

I'menvisioning a campaign that's both visually stunning and engaging. I want to create something that will really capture people's attention and make them want to learn more about the game.

I've attached a few sketches of my initial ideas. I'd love to get your feedback on them and see what you think.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ernie
