Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming recruitment drive for our new game, Gizzard Quest. I'm hoping you can spare some time to meet with me to discuss our hiring goals and strategies.

As you know, we're looking to add a number of new team members to work on Gizzard Quest. We need to find people who are passionate about games, have a strong work ethic, and are able to work well in a team environment.

I'm thinking that we should hold a series of workshops and events to attract potential candidates. We could also reach out to our network of contacts in the gaming industry.

I'd love to get your thoughts on this. Do you have any ideas about how we can attract the best possible candidates?

I'm available to meet with you at your convenience. Just let me know when works best for you.

Thanks,
Scarlett
