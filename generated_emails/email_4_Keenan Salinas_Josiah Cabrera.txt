Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on the campaign plan, and I wanted to get your thoughts on it before I finalize it.

I'm thinking that we should focus on two main things:

* **Creating a sense of urgency.** We need to make people feel like they need to buy Splatty McSplat right away, before it's too late. We can do this by creating a sense of scarcity, and by highlighting the benefits of buying the game now.
* **Building excitement.** We need to make people excited about Splatty McSplat. We can do this by showing off the game's features, and by getting people talking about it.

I've attached a copy of the campaign plan for you to review. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

Thanks,
Keenan
