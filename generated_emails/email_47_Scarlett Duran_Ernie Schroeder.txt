Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the new level design for the upcoming Mario game. I've got a few ideas that I think you might like, so I'd love to set up a time to chat about them.

I'm free on Monday afternoons and Wednesday mornings, or we can meet after work on Friday. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Scarlett
