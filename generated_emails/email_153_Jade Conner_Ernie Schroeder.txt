Hi Ernie,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, "Spintendo Gizzard: The Quest for the Golden Egg."

As you know, this is a big project for us, and we're all very excited about it. I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

However, I'm also aware that there are a lot of moving parts involved in a launch of this magnitude, and I wanted to make sure that we're all on the same page.

I'm particularly concerned about the marketing and PR campaign. I think it's essential that we hit the ground running and make a big splash.

I'd like to propose that we hold a launch party at a major gaming convention. This would be a great opportunity to get the word out about our game and generate some excitement.

I've already spoken to Victor Vang, our Head of HR, and he's agreed to help us organize the event.

I'm also working with Scarlett Duran, our Lead Game Designer, to develop some promotional materials.

I'm confident that we can pull this off, but I need your help to make it happen.

Can you please take a look at the proposed budget and let me know if you have any concerns?

I'd also like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the marketing and PR campaign in more detail.

Thanks,
Jade
