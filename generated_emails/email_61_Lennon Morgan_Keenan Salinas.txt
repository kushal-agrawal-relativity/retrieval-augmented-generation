Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you about the recent increase in DDoS attacks on our servers. I've been working with our security team to mitigate these attacks, but we're still seeing a significant amount of downtime.

I'm concerned that these attacks could be costing us customers and revenue. I'd like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss our options for further securing our servers.

Would you be available to meet with me this week? I'm available on Monday at 10am, Tuesday at 2pm, or Wednesday at 4pm.

Thanks,
Lennon
