Hey Lennon,

I'm reaching out to you because I'm looking for some advice on our upcoming marketing campaign. I'm particularly interested in how we can use our social media channels to reach a wider audience.

I know you're the go-to person for all things networking, so I was hoping you could spare a few minutes to chat with me about our options. I'm free anytime this week, so just let me know what works best for you.

Thanks in advance,
Josiah
