Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in network outages. As you know, our network has been unstable for the past few weeks, and this has caused a number of problems for our employees.

I've been working with our team to troubleshoot the issue, and we believe that we've identified the source of the problem. We're currently working on a fix, and we expect to have the issue resolved by the end of the week.

In the meantime, I'm asking that you please let your team know that we're aware of the issue and that we're working hard to resolve it. I'm also asking that you please let us know if you or your team experience any further problems with the network.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best,
Lennon
