Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of expanding our marketing team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and I think it's time we start to put more resources into marketing.

I've been doing some research, and I think we could really benefit from hiring a social media manager and a content writer. A social media manager would be responsible for managing our social media accounts and creating engaging content, while a content writer would be responsible for writing blog posts, articles, and other marketing materials.

I believe that these two positions would be a valuable addition to our team, and I think they would help us to reach a wider audience and grow our business. I've attached a budget and a job description for each position, and I'd love to discuss this further with you at your convenience.

Thanks,
Jade
