Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm a bit concerned about the budget that's been allocated for the campaign. I think it's too low, and I'm worried that we won't be able to reach our target audience.

I've done some research, and I've found that similar games have had marketing campaigns that were twice as expensive as the one we're planning. I think we need to increase our budget if we want to have a successful launch.

I'm open to discussing this further with you. Let me know when you're free.

Thanks,
Ernie
