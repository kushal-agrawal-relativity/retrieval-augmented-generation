Hi Ernie,

I'm Lennon, the network admin here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in DDoS attacks on our servers.

As you know, DDoS attacks are a serious threat to our business. They can disrupt our services, damage our reputation, and cost us money.

I've been working with our security team to investigate these attacks, and we've identified a few potential vulnerabilities that we need to address.

I'm confident that we can fix these vulnerabilities and protect our servers from future attacks. However, I need your help to make sure that our developers are aware of the risks and are taking steps to protect their code.

I'm planning to send out a security awareness email to all of our developers, but I wanted to reach out to you directly first to get your input.

Do you have any suggestions for how we can make our developers more aware of the risks of DDoS attacks?

I'm also open to suggestions for ways to improve our security measures.

Thanks for your time,
Lennon
