Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the new game design that I've been working on. I'm really excited about it, and I think it has the potential to be a big hit.

I've attached a few documents that you can take a look at. They include a brief overview of the game, as well as some concept art and gameplay videos.

I'd love to get your feedback on this. Do you have any thoughts on how we can improve it? Are there any features that you think we should add or remove?

I'm available to chat anytime this week if you want to discuss it further. Just let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Scarlett
