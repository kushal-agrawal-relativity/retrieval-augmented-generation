Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that show off the game's features. I think this would be a great way to reach a wider audience and get people excited about the game.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer. This would be a great way to get our game in front of a new audience.

I'm also considering running a contest or giveaway. This could be a fun way to generate some buzz around the game.

I'm open to other ideas as well. What do you think? Which of these ideas do you think is the most promising? Do you have any other ideas that you think would be better?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Josiah
