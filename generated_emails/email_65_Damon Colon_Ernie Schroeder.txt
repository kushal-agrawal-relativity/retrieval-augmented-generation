Hey Ernie,

I'm Damon Colon, the Head of Art here at Spintendo Gizzard. I wanted to reach out and see if you had any time this week to chat about the new game we're working on. I'm particularly interested in getting your feedback on the character designs, as I think your input would be really valuable.

Would you be free to meet up on Monday or Tuesday at 10am? We could grab a coffee in the break room or hop on a Zoom call, whichever works best for you.

Let me know what works for you.

Damon
