Hey Lennon,

I'm reaching out to you because I'm looking for some advice on our upcoming marketing campaign. I'm specifically interested in how we can best utilize our social media channels to reach our target audience.

I know you're not a marketer by trade, but you've always been great at using social media to engage with our fans. I'd love to get your thoughts on how we can use our channels to generate excitement for our new game.

Can you spare a few minutes this week to chat? I'm free on Monday and Wednesday after 3pm.

Thanks,
Josiah
