Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Spindlewood." I'm really excited about this game, and I think it's going to be a big hit.

I wanted to get your input on the marketing plan for the game. I know you've got a lot of experience in this area, and I would really value your opinion.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can reach out to new audiences and get them excited about the game. I think it's important that we do a good job of marketing this game, so that we can make sure it's a success.

I'm open to any ideas you have, so please let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wilma
