Hi Lennon,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent spike in DDoS attacks that we've been experiencing. As you know, these attacks have been causing a significant disruption to our game servers, and we need to take action to mitigate the damage.

I've been doing some research on the best ways to defend against DDoS attacks, and I think that we should implement a few new security measures. First, we should upgrade our firewall to a more robust solution that can better withstand attack. Second, we should implement a DDoS scrubbing service that can filter out malicious traffic before it reaches our servers. Finally, we should educate our employees on how to identify and report DDoS attacks.

I've attached a proposal that outlines these security measures in more detail. I'd like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss this proposal and get your feedback. Please let me know when you're available.

Thanks,
Jade
