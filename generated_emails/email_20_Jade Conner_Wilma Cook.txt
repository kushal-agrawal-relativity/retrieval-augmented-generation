Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of increasing our marketing budget for the upcoming fiscal year. As you know, our marketing efforts have been very successful in the past, and I believe that a larger budget would allow us to reach even more potential customers and grow our business.

I've attached a proposal that outlines my plan for how we would use the additional funds. I've also included some data that shows how our marketing efforts have paid off in the past.

I'd love to discuss this proposal with you further and get your thoughts. Please let me know if you're available for a meeting next week.

Thanks,
Jade
