Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming sales quarter. As you know, this is our most important quarter of the year, and we need to make sure we're on track to meet our sales goals.

I've been looking at the numbers, and I'm concerned that we're not where we need to be. We're behind on our sales targets by 10%, and we only have a few weeks left to make up the difference.

I'm confident that we can do this, but we need to work together. I'm asking you to reach out to your team and see what we can do to increase our sales. Are there any new marketing campaigns we can run? Are there any new products or features we can offer that would appeal to our customers?

I know you're up to the challenge, Keenan. Let's work together and make this quarter a success.

Thanks,
Wilma
