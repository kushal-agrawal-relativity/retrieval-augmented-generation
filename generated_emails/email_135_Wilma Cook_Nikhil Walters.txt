Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, Splatty McBlot. As you know, this is a major project for our company, and I'm confident that it will be a huge success.

I'm particularly excited about the work that you've been doing on the game's technical infrastructure. You've really outdone yourself, and I'm confident that the game will be able to handle the massive influx of players that we're expecting.

I'm also very impressed with the work that the rest of the team has been doing. Everyone is really pulling together, and I can feel the excitement building as we get closer to launch day.

I know that you're all working hard, but I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your hard work. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished together, and I can't wait to see what we can achieve in the future.

Best,
Wilma
