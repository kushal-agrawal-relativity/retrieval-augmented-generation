Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in DDoS attacks on our servers. As you know, these attacks have been causing a significant amount of downtime and lost revenue.

I've been working with our security team to investigate the attacks and develop a plan to mitigate them. We believe that the attacks are being carried out by a group of hacktivists who are targeting our company because of our political views.

I'm concerned that these attacks are going to continue, and I'm worried about the impact they're going to have on our business. I'm proposing that we invest in a new DDoS mitigation solution to protect our servers.

I've attached a proposal from our security team that outlines the costs and benefits of this solution. I'd like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss this proposal further and get your approval to move forward.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Lennon
