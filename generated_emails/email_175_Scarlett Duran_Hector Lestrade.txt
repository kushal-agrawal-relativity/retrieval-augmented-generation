Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Spindledorf. I've been working on the game design for the past few months, and I'm really excited about the way it's coming together. I think it has the potential to be a really big hit.

I've been thinking about how we can best market the game, and I think it would be really effective to partner with a popular YouTuber. I've done some research, and I think we should reach out to PewDiePie. He has a huge following, and I think he would be a great fit for our game.

I've attached a proposal that outlines my plan for the marketing campaign. I'd love to get your thoughts on it.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Scarlett
