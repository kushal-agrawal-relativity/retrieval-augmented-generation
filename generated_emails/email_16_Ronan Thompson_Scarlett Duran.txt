Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you about the new level design for the upcoming game. I have a few ideas that I think would really improve the gameplay, and I'd love to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to add more verticality to the levels. This would make the game more challenging and exciting, and it would also give players more options for movement. For example, we could add platforms that players can climb up and down, or we could have enemies that fly overhead.

Another idea is to make the levels more interconnected. This would allow players to explore more of the world and find secrets. For example, we could have secret passages that lead to hidden areas, or we could have multiple paths that players can take to reach the end of the level.

I think these are just a few ideas that could make the game more fun and challenging. I'd love to hear your thoughts on them, and I'm also open to other suggestions.

Let me know what you think!

Ronan
