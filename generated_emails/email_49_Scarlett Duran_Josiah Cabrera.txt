Hi Josiah,

I'm reaching out to you about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I've got a few ideas that I wanted to run by you and get your thoughts.

I'm thinking we could do a big social media push, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We could create some fun, engaging content that would get people excited about the game. We could also partner with some influencers to get the word out.

I'm also thinking we could do some paid advertising. We could target people who are interested in gaming, or who have a history of playing our games.

I'm open to other ideas, too. What do you think? What would you like to see for the marketing campaign?

Let me know what you think, and we can start putting together a plan.

Thanks,
Scarlett
