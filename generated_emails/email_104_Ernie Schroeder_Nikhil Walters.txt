Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm concerned that we're not doing enough to promote the game, and I think we're going to miss out on a lot of sales if we don't do something soon.

I know that you're busy with all the technical aspects of the game, but I think you need to take some time to focus on marketing. We need to get the word out about Splatty McSplat, and we need to do it now.

I've been doing some research, and I think we should focus on social media. We need to create a presence on all the major platforms, and we need to start posting regular updates about the game. We should also be running contests and giveaways to generate excitement.

I'm happy to help out with the marketing, but I need your approval to move forward. Can we talk about this at our next meeting?

Thanks,
Ernie
