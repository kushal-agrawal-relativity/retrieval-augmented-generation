Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game. As you know, this is a critical project for the company, and I'm confident that you and your team are up to the challenge.

I've been hearing great things about the progress you're making, and I'm particularly impressed with the way you've been able to stay on top of the schedule and budget. However, I'm concerned that we're not doing enough to promote the game ahead of its launch.

I think we need to do a better job of getting the word out about this game. We need to make sure that potential customers know about it, and we need to create a sense of excitement and anticipation.

I'm open to suggestions on how we can do this, but I think we need to start by developing a comprehensive marketing plan. This plan should include everything from social media campaigns to paid advertising.

I'm confident that we can make this game a success, but we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to promote it.

Let me know what you think.

Best,
Wilma
