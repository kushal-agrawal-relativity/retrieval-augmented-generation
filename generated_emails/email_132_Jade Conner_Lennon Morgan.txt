Hi Lennon,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in DDoS attacks on our network. As you know, these attacks have been disruptive to our business and have caused us to lose revenue.

I'm working with our security team to develop a plan to mitigate these attacks. I'd like to include you in this process, as your expertise in network administration will be invaluable.

I'm going to set up a meeting for next week to discuss this further. I'll send you the details as soon as I have them.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks,
Jade
