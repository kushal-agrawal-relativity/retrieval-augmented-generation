Hi Josiah,

I'm reaching out to you about the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I've been working on some ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

I'm thinking that we could do a social media campaign, where we promote the game on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. We could also run some ads on Google and YouTube.

I'm also thinking that we could do a PR campaign, where we send out press releases and get some coverage in gaming magazines and websites.

I'm still in the early stages of planning, so I'm open to any ideas you have. What do you think?

Let me know if you want to chat more about this.

Thanks,
Scarlett
