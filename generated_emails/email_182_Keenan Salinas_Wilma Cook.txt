Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of expanding our account management team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and I think it's time we added some more people to help manage our growing client base.

I've been doing some research, and I think we could really benefit from hiring a couple of Account Executives. These AEs would be responsible for developing and maintaining relationships with our existing clients, as well as bringing in new business.

I've attached a job description and a salary range for your review. I'd love to discuss this further with you at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,
Keenan
