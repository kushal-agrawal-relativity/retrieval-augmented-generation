Lennon,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent increase in network outages. As you know, these outages have been causing a lot of problems for our employees and customers.

I'm concerned that the current network infrastructure is not scalable enough to meet our growing needs. I'd like to work with you to develop a plan to upgrade our network so that we can avoid these outages in the future.

I'm available to meet with you at your convenience to discuss this further. Please let me know when you'd like to chat.

Thanks,
Nikhil
