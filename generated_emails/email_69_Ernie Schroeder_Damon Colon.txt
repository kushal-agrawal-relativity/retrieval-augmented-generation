Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to you about the new character design for the upcoming game. I really like what you've come up with so far, but I have a few suggestions that I think could make it even better.

First, I think the character's eyes are a little too big. I think it would be more visually appealing if they were a little smaller.

Second, I think the character's mouth is a little too wide. I think it would be more realistic if it was a little narrower.

Finally, I think the character's hair is a little too messy. I think it would look better if it was a little more styled.

I know you're a talented artist, and I'm confident that you can take these suggestions and make the character even better. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ernie
