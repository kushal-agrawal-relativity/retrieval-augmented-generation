Hi Nikhil,

I'm writing to you about the new game design document that I'm working on. I wanted to get your thoughts on it before I finalize it and send it to the rest of the team.

I'm particularly interested in your feedback on the new level design that I've been working on. I think it's a big improvement over the previous design, but I'd love to hear your thoughts before I move forward.

I'm also open to any other feedback you have on the document. I know you're really busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at it and let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Scarlett
