Hey Keenan,

I'm Damon, the Head of Art here at Spintendo Gizzard. I'm reaching out to you because I'm working on a new project and I need your help.

I'm designing a new character for our upcoming game, and I'm looking for some feedback on the concept art. I've attached a few images to this email, but I'd love to hear your thoughts in person. Can you spare a few minutes this afternoon to chat?

Thanks,
Damon
