Hey Lennon,

I'm reaching out to you because I'm having some trouble with the network on my computer. I'm not sure if it's a problem with my computer or with the network itself, but I was hoping you could take a look at it.

I'm specifically having trouble connecting to the VPN. When I try to connect, I get an error message saying that "the connection was refused." I've tried restarting my computer and my router, but the problem persists.

I'm available to meet with you at your convenience to take a look at the problem. Just let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Scarlett
