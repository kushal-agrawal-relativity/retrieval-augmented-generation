Hi Scarlett,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to follow up on our conversation last week about the network outage. I've been doing some digging, and I think I've found the source of the problem.

It looks like there was a misconfiguration in the DNS server that was causing traffic to be routed incorrectly. I've already made the necessary changes, and I'm confident that this will resolve the issue.

I'll be monitoring the situation closely, and I'll let you know if I see any further problems. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon
