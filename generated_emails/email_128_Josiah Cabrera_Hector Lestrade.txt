Hi Hector,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we could do a big social media push, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We could create some fun and engaging content that would get people excited about the game. We could also run some paid advertising campaigns to target specific demographics.

I'm also considering doing some traditional marketing, like print ads and TV commercials. I think this would be a good way to reach people who aren't as active on social media.

I'm still in the early stages of planning, so I'm open to any ideas you have. What do you think about my proposed marketing campaign? Do you have any other ideas that we could explore?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Josiah
