Hey Lennon,

Hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you because I'm working on a new marketing campaign for our upcoming game, and I need your help with a few things.

First, I need to get a list of all the IP addresses that our players are using. Can you send me that information as soon as possible?

Second, I need to know how many players we have in each region. Can you give me a breakdown by country?

Finally, I need to know how much bandwidth our players are using each month. Can you provide me with that information as well?

I know this is a lot to ask, but it would be a huge help. I'm really excited about this campaign, and I think it's going to be a big success.

Thanks for your time,
Josiah
