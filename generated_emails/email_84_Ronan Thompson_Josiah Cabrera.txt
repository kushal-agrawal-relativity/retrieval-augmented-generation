Hey Josiah,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any thoughts on how we can improve our marketing strategy for the upcoming release of our new game. I'm particularly interested in hearing your thoughts on how we can reach a wider audience and generate more excitement for the game.

I know you're busy, but I would really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to chat with me about this. I'm free anytime this week, so just let me know when works best for you.

Thanks,
Ronan
