Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the recent network outages we've been experiencing. I've been investigating the issue, and I believe I've found the source of the problem.

It looks like the issue is with our DNS servers. I've been working on a fix, and I'm hoping to have it implemented by the end of the week.

In the meantime, I've put in place some temporary measures to help mitigate the impact of the outages. I've created a list of IP addresses that can be used to access our internal resources. I've also set up a VPN that employees can use to connect to our network securely.

I'll keep you updated on my progress. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon
