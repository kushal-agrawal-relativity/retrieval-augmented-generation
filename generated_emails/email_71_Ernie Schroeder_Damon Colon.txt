Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to you because I'm really digging the new character designs you've been working on for the new game. I think they're really on point and capture the spirit of the game perfectly.

I'm particularly fond of the way you've designed the main character. She's got a really cool, badass vibe that I think is going to really resonate with players.

I know you're busy, but I was wondering if you could spare a few minutes to chat about the character designs. I'd love to get your thoughts on a few ideas I have for some of the other characters.

Let me know if you're free sometime this week.

Thanks,
Ernie
