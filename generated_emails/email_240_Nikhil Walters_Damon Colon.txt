Hi Damon,

I'm writing to you about the new art direction for our upcoming game. I've been working with Ronan and Scarlett on the concept, and we're really excited about the direction we're heading in.

I wanted to get your thoughts on the new style. We're thinking of going for a more stylized look, with a focus on bright colors and bold graphics. We think this will help to create a more engaging and visually appealing experience for players.

I've attached a few images of the concept art so you can get a better idea of what we're thinking. Let me know what you think, and we can discuss it further at our next team meeting.

Thanks,
Nikhil
