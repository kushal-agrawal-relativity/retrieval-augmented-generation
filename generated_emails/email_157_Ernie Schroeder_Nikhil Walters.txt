Dear Nikhil,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty the Splatfish." I'm excited to share that we've been working on a new marketing campaign that I think will really help to boost sales.

As you know, our target audience for this game is children ages 6-12. We've developed a series of TV commercials that feature Splatty the Splatfish and his friends having fun and getting into all sorts of wacky adventures. We're also planning to launch a social media campaign that will use influencers to promote the game to their followers.

I'm confident that this marketing campaign will be a success, and I'm looking forward to seeing the results. I'll keep you updated on our progress.

Thanks,
Ernie
