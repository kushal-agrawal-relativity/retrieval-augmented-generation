Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working with Josiah Cabrera, our Head of Marketing, to come up with a plan, and we'd love to get your input.

We're thinking of doing a big social media push, with a focus on Instagram and TikTok. We'll be creating some fun and engaging content that will appeal to our target audience of young adults. We're also planning to run some paid advertising campaigns to reach a wider audience.

We'd love to get your thoughts on this plan. Do you think it's on the right track? Are there any areas where you think we could improve?

We're also looking for a product manager to lead the development of Splatty McSplat. Do you have any suggestions for people who might be a good fit for the role?

Thanks for your time,
Keenan
