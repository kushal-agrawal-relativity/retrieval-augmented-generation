Hi Ernie,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Spintendo Gizzard.

As you know, this is a big game for us, and we want to make sure that we do everything we can to promote it. I think that we could really benefit from working with a celebrity influencer to help us spread the word.

I've been doing some research, and I think that we should reach out to Charli D'Amelio. She's a huge TikTok star with over 100 million followers. I think that she would be a great fit for our game, and she could help us reach a whole new audience.

I've attached a proposal that outlines our plan in more detail. I'd love to get your thoughts on it and see if you think it's something we should pursue.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Hector
