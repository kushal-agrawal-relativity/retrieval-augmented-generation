Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the new art assets for the upcoming game. I've been working on them for the past few weeks, and I think they're finally ready for your review.

I've attached the files to this email. Could you take a look and let me know what you think? I'm especially interested in your feedback on the character designs and the level layouts.

I'm available to chat if you have any questions. Just let me know.

Thanks,
Damon
