Hi Wilma,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming PR campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber to create a series of videos about the game. This would be a great way to reach a new audience and generate excitement for the release.

Another idea is to run a contest on social media. We could ask fans to create their own Splatty McSplat-themed art or videos. The winner could receive a prize, such as a free copy of the game or a gift card.

I'm also open to other ideas. What do you think would be the best way to promote Splatty McSplat?

Let me know what you think. I'm available to chat anytime this week.

Thanks,
Hector
