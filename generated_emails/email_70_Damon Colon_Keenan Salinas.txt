Hey Keenan,

I'm reaching out to you about the new character designs for the upcoming game. I've got a few initial thoughts that I wanted to run by you before we move forward with the finalization.

First, I think the character designs are looking great overall. The characters are visually appealing and have a lot of personality. However, I have a few suggestions that I think could make them even better.

* I think the characters could be more expressive. Right now, they all have pretty neutral expressions, which makes it difficult to read their emotions. I think adding a bit more variety to their expressions would help to make them more engaging.
* I also think the characters could use a bit more variation in their body types. Right now, they all have pretty similar builds. I think adding some variety in height, weight, and body shape would help to make them feel more unique.

I know these are just a few suggestions, and you're free to take them or leave them. But I thought I'd throw them out there in case you find them helpful.

Let me know what you think.

Damon
