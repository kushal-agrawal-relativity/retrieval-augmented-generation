Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the progress of the new game engine. As you know, we've been working on this for a few months now, and I'm happy to report that we're making great progress.

We've already completed the basic architecture of the engine, and we're now working on the more complex features. I'm confident that we'll be able to deliver a high-quality engine that will meet our customers' needs.

I'm also excited to announce that we've been able to recruit some top talent to work on the project. We've brought on a new lead engineer, Ronan Thompson, who has a wealth of experience in this field. Ronan is already making a big contribution to the team, and I'm confident that he'll help us to create a world-class engine.

I'll keep you updated on our progress, and I'll let you know as soon as we have a more concrete timeline for completion.

Thanks,
Nikhil
