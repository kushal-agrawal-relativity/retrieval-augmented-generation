Hi Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming round of layoffs. As you know, we've been facing some tough financial challenges lately, and we've made the difficult decision to lay off a number of employees.

I know this is a difficult time for everyone involved, and I want to thank you for your understanding and support. I want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to make this transition as smooth as possible for everyone affected.

I've attached a list of the employees who will be laid off. I've also included a severance package that we're providing to all affected employees.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Victor
