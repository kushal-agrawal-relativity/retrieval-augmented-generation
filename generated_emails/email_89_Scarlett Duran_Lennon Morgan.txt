Hi Lennon,

I'm writing to you about the new networking infrastructure that we're planning to implement. I'd like to get your input on the design and implementation, since you're the network administrator.

I'm thinking that we should use a distributed architecture, with a mesh of routers and switches. This would give us the most flexibility and scalability.

I'm also considering using a cloud-based solution for our DNS and DHCP services. This would make it easier to manage and update our DNS records, and it would also provide us with a more reliable DHCP service.

I'd like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss these ideas in more detail. Can you make yourself available sometime next week?

Thanks,
Scarlett
