Hi Ernie,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming product launch of our new game, "Spintendo Gizzard: The Quest for the Golden Egg."

As you know, this is a major project for our company, and we're all very excited about it. I'm confident that it's going to be a huge success.

However, I'm also aware that there are a lot of moving parts involved in a product launch of this magnitude, and I wanted to make sure that we're all on the same page.

I'm specifically concerned about the marketing and PR campaign for the game. I think it's essential that we do a really good job of promoting the game, and I'm not sure that we have the resources in-house to do it effectively.

I'm wondering if you would be willing to work with me on this? I think your experience in the marketing and PR field would be invaluable to us.

Of course, I'm happy to discuss this further with you in person if you'd like. Just let me know when you're available.

Thanks,
Victor
