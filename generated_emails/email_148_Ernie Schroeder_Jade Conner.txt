Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I'm excited to share that we've been working on a new marketing campaign that I think you'll really like.

We're going to be using a combination of social media, paid advertising, and influencer marketing to reach our target audience. I've attached a brief overview of the campaign, but I'd love to chat with you more about it in person. Can we set up a time to meet this week?

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Ernie
