Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of adding a new game server to our network. As you know, we've been experiencing some latency issues with our current servers, and I think adding a new one would help to improve performance.

I've been doing some research, and I found a few good deals on servers that would be a good fit for our needs. I'd like to get your approval to purchase one so that I can start the process of setting it up.

I'm also open to any other suggestions you might have for improving our network performance. Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Lennon
