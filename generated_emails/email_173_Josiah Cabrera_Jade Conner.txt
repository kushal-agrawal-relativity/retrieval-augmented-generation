Hi Jade,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I'm thinking that we could focus on the game's unique features, such as the ability to create your own levels and share them with friends. I think this would be a great way to engage our audience and get them excited about the game.

I've also been thinking about creating a contest where players can submit their own levels. The winner could get a prize, such as a free copy of the game or a gift card. This would be a great way to generate some buzz around the game and attract new players.

I'm still working out the details, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on these ideas. Let me know if you have any suggestions of your own.

Thanks,
Josiah
