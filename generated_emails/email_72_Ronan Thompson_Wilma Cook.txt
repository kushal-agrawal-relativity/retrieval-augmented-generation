Hi Wilma,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the progress of the new game engine. As you know, we've been working on this for a few months now, and I'm happy to report that we're making great progress.

We've already completed the basic framework, and we're now working on the more complex features. I'm confident that we'll be able to deliver a high-quality product that meets your expectations.

I'm also excited to announce that we've been able to recruit a new engineer to the team. Her name is Sarah, and she's a recent graduate from MIT. She's a brilliant engineer, and I'm confident that she'll be a valuable asset to the team.

I'll keep you updated on our progress, and I'll let you know as soon as we have a more concrete timeline for the release.

Thanks,
Ronan
