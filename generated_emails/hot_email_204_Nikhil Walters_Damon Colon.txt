Hi Damon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the recent security breach that we experienced. As you know, a hacker gained access to our servers and stole a significant amount of data, including customer information and financial records.

I'm sure you're aware that this is a serious matter, and we're doing everything we can to investigate the breach and prevent it from happening again. However, I wanted to reach out to you personally to let you know that I'm aware of your involvement in the incident.

I know that you were trying to help the company, but what you did was wrong. We need to be careful about how we handle this situation, so I'm asking you to keep this conversation between us.

I'm confident that we can work together to get through this, and I appreciate your cooperation.

Nikhil
