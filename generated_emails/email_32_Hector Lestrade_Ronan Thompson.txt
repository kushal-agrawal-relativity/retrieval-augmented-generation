Hi Ronan,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. As you know, this is a big game for us, and we need to make sure that we get the marketing right.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how we can best target our core audience of 10- to 12-year-olds. What kind of messaging do you think will resonate with them? What kind of platforms should we focus on?

I'd love to get your thoughts on this as soon as possible. We're on a tight deadline, so the sooner we can get started, the better.

Thanks,
Hector
