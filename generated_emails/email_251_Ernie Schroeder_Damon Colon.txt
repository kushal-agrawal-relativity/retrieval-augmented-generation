Hey Damon,

I'm reaching out to get your thoughts on the new character designs for the upcoming game. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on the new character for the villain. Do you think it's too over-the-top? I'm worried that it might be a bit too cartoonish for the game's target audience.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Ernie
