Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat.

As you know, we're planning to launch Splatty McSplat in the next few months, and we need to start planning our marketing campaign now. I'm thinking that we should focus on social media, as that's where our target audience is most active.

I'd like to work with you to come up with a strategy for promoting Splatty McSplat on social media. I think we should create some fun and engaging content that will get people excited about the game. We could also run some contests and giveaways to generate buzz.

I'm open to any ideas you have, so please let me know what you think. We need to get started on this campaign as soon as possible, so let's chat soon.

Thanks,
Josiah
