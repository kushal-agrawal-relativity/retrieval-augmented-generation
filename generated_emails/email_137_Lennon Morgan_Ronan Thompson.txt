Hey Ronan,

I'm Lennon, the network admin here at Spintendo Gizzard. I just wanted to check in and see if you've had any luck with that latency issue we've been having on the new game server. I know you've been working on it for a while, and I just wanted to see if there's anything I can do to help.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything.

Thanks,
Lennon
