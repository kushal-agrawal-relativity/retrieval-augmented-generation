Hi Jade,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty McSplat. I'm excited to announce that we're planning to launch a new marketing campaign to promote the game.

I've been working with the marketing team to come up with a plan, and we're all really excited about it. We think this is a great opportunity to reach a wider audience and generate some buzz for the game.

I'm going to send you a more detailed proposal later this week, but I wanted to give you a heads up so you can start thinking about it.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Nikhil
