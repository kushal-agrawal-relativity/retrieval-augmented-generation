Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I think we should focus on creating a sense of urgency and excitement around the game. We can do this by releasing teasers and trailers early, and by running contests and giveaways. I also think we should partner with influencers to get the word out about the game.

What do you think? Do you have any other ideas for the marketing campaign?

Let me know what you think by the end of the week.

Thanks,
Nikhil
