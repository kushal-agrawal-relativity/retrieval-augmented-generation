Hey Scarlett,

Hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to you because I'm having some trouble with the new prototype for the upcoming game. I'm not sure if I'm just not understanding the instructions or if there's a bug, but I can't seem to get the character to move properly.

Would you be able to take a look at it and see if you can spot anything I'm missing? I'm available anytime tomorrow if you're free.

Thanks,
Ernie
