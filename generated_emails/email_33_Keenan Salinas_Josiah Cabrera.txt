Hi Josiah,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your feedback.

I think we should focus on creating a sense of urgency and excitement around the game. We could do this by releasing teaser trailers and gameplay videos early, and by running contests and giveaways. I also think it would be a good idea to partner with influencers and streamers to get the word out about the game.

I'm open to any suggestions you have, so please let me know what you think.

We're on a tight deadline, so I'd like to get started as soon as possible. Can we meet sometime this week to discuss this further?

Thanks,
Keenan
