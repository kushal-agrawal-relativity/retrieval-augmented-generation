Dear Ernie,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming launch of our new game, "Spintendo Gizzard: The Quest for the Golden Egg." As you know, this is our most ambitious project to date, and we're all very excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the marketing campaign for this game. We've been working with our marketing team to come up with a really creative and engaging campaign that we think will really resonate with our target audience.

I'm also looking forward to working with you on this project. I know that you have a lot of experience in product management, and I'm confident that you'll be able to help us make this game a success.

I'm available to chat anytime this week if you have any questions or want to discuss the project further. Just let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Keenan
