Hi Damon,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming art contest for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. We're looking for talented artists to create new characters, environments, and props for the game.

The contest will be open to all Spintendo Gizzard employees, and the winner will receive a $1,000 prize and their work will be featured in the game.

We're looking for creative and innovative designs that will help to bring Splatty's Adventure to life. The contest will run for two weeks, starting on Monday, March 1st.

To enter the contest, simply submit your work to me by email. Please include a brief description of your work and your name.

We're looking forward to seeing your submissions!

Best,
Victor
