Hi Scarlett,

I'm reaching out to see if you'd be interested in collaborating on a new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. I think your expertise in game design would be really valuable in developing a campaign that's both engaging and informative.

I'm thinking we could do something along the lines of a video series, where you walk players through the different aspects of the game. This would be a great way to show off the game's features and get people excited about playing it.

I'm also open to other ideas, so let me know what you think. If you're interested, we can set up a time to chat more about it.

Thanks,
Josiah
