Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, Splatty's Adventure. As you know, this is our most ambitious game yet, and we're all really excited about it.

I'm particularly excited about the new game engine that we're using for this project. It's a lot more powerful than our previous engine, and it's going to allow us to create some really amazing visuals.

I'm also really impressed with the work that you've been doing on the game design. You've really nailed the balance between challenge and fun, and I think players are going to love it.

I know that you're working hard to get the game finished on time, and I just wanted to say thanks for all your hard work. I'm really confident that this is going to be a huge success.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to help.

Best,
Jade
