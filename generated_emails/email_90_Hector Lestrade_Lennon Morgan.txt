Hey Lennon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Spindledorf's Quest."

As you know, we're planning to launch this game in a few months, and we're really excited about the potential it has. We think it's going to be a big hit, and we want to make sure that we do everything we can to promote it.

I'm wondering if you could give me some advice on how to best reach our target audience. We're targeting gamers of all ages, but we're particularly interested in reaching those who are 18-34 years old.

Do you have any ideas about how we can reach this audience? Are there any specific websites or social media platforms that we should focus on?

Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Hector
