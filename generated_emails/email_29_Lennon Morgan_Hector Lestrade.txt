Hey Hector,

I just wanted to check in and see if you have any updates on the PR campaign for the new game. I know you're working on a tight deadline, so I don't want to bother you if you're still swamped. But I just wanted to make sure we're on track for the launch next month.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything from me.

Thanks,
Lennon
