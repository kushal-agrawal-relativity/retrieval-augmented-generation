Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you about the recent increase in network outages. I've been investigating the issue, and I believe it's due to a recent change we made to the DNS server. I've reverted the change, and I'm monitoring the network to see if the outages stop.

I'll keep you updated on my progress. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon
