Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of adding a new account manager to our team. As you know, we've been growing rapidly over the past few months, and our current account managers are starting to get stretched thin. I think adding a new person would help us to better serve our customers and provide them with a more personalized experience.

I've already started looking for candidates, and I'm confident that I can find someone who is a good fit for our company culture and has the skills and experience we need. I'm planning to bring a few candidates to you for your approval next week.

I'd also like to discuss the possibility of creating a new account management team within our department. I think this would help us to be more organized and efficient, and it would give our account managers more support and resources.

I'm open to any suggestions you have on this matter. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss it further.

Thanks,
Keenan
