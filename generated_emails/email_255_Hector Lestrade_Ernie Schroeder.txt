Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to see if you have any updates on the new marketing campaign for our upcoming game. We're starting to get a little close to the launch date, and I'd like to make sure we're on track.

Can you give me a status update by the end of the week? I'd also like to know if you have any questions or need anything from me.

Thanks,
Hector
