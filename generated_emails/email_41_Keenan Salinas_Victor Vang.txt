Hi Victor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the possibility of creating a new account management position at Spintendo Gizzard. As you know, our account management team has been growing rapidly over the past few years, and I believe that it's time to add another level of support to our clients.

The new account manager would be responsible for managing a portfolio of accounts, providing support to clients, and developing relationships with key decision-makers. This person would need to be highly organized, have excellent communication skills, and be able to work independently.

I believe that this position would be a valuable addition to our team, and I'm confident that it would help us to better serve our clients. I'm happy to discuss this further with you at your convenience.

Thanks,
Keenan
