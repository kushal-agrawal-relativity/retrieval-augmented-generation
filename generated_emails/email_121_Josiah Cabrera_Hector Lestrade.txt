Hey Hector,

I wanted to reach out and see if you'd be available to chat about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game. I've got a few ideas I'd like to run by you and get your thoughts.

Do you have any time this week to meet up? I'm free on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning.

Let me know what works for you.

Thanks,
Josiah
