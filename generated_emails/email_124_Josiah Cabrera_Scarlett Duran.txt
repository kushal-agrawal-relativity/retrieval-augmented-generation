Hi Scarlett,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty's Adventure. I've been working on a few ideas, and I'd love to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that showcase the game's unique features. I think this would be a great way to generate excitement and buzz around the game.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer to promote the game. This could be a great way to reach a wider audience.

I'm also considering running a contest or giveaway to promote the game. This could be a fun way to get people excited and engaged.

I'm open to other ideas as well. What do you think? What would be the best way to market Splatty's Adventure?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Josiah
