Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, Splatty McSplat. I've been working on a few ideas, and I wanted to get your thoughts on them.

One idea is to create a series of short, funny videos that show off the game's unique features. I think this would be a great way to generate interest and excitement among potential players.

Another idea is to partner with a popular YouTuber or streamer to promote the game. This could be a great way to reach a wider audience.

I'm also considering running a contest or giveaway to help build hype for the game. This could be a fun way to engage with potential players and get them excited about the release.

I'm open to other ideas as well. What do you think about these? Do you have any other suggestions?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Nikhil
