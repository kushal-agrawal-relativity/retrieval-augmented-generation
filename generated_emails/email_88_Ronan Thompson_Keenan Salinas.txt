Hey Keenan,

I'm reaching out to see if you have any availability this week to chat about the new account management software we're looking at implementing. I've got a few questions I wanted to run you by and I think it would be helpful to get your perspective on the matter.

Would you be free to hop on a call sometime this week? I'm available on Tuesday at 10am, Wednesday at 2pm, or Thursday at 11am.

Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks,
Ronan
