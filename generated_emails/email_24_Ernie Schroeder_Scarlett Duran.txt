Hi Scarlett,

I wanted to reach out and see how you're feeling about the new game design direction we're taking with the upcoming project. I know you had some reservations about it at first, but I'm curious to hear if your opinion has changed since we started working on it.

I'm personally really excited about the possibilities this new direction opens up for us. I think it's a chance to really do something different and innovative, and I think it could set us apart from the competition.

But I also know that change can be scary, and I want to make sure that you're on board with what we're doing. So if you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I'm looking forward to hearing what you think.

Best,
Ernie
