Hi Ernie,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign for our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." I've been working with the marketing team to develop a plan, and I wanted to get your input before we move forward.

We're planning to launch a multi-platform campaign that will target both casual and hardcore gamers. We'll be using a variety of channels, including social media, paid advertising, and email marketing.

I'm particularly excited about our plans for social media. We're going to create a dedicated Splatty's Adventure account and use it to engage with fans, share news and updates, and promote the game. We'll also be running contests and giveaways to generate excitement.

I'm confident that this campaign will be a success. We have a great team in place, and we're working with a strong marketing partner.

I'd love to get your thoughts on our plans. Do you have any suggestions or feedback?

Thanks,
Keenan
