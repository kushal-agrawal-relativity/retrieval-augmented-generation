Hey Josiah,

I'm putting together a proposal for a new marketing campaign, and I wanted to get your thoughts on it. I'm thinking of doing a series of short animated videos that promote our latest game. The videos would be funny and engaging, and they would give players a taste of what the game is all about.

I think this would be a great way to reach new players and get them excited about our game. What do you think? Do you have any ideas for the videos?

Let me know what you think.

Damon
