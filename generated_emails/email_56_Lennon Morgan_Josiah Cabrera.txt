Hi Josiah,

I'm writing to you about the recent increase in DDoS attacks on our servers. I've been working with our security team to investigate the attacks and develop a plan to mitigate them.

We've identified a few potential causes for the attacks, including:

* A vulnerability in our web application that allows attackers to exploit a buffer overflow
* A misconfiguration in our firewall that allows attackers to bypass our security measures
* A botnet that is scanning the internet for vulnerable servers

We're currently working to fix these vulnerabilities and implement new security measures to protect our servers from future attacks.

I'll keep you updated on our progress and let you know when we're confident that our servers are secure.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
Lennon
