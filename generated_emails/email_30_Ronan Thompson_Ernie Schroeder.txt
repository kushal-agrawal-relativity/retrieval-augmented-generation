Hi Ernie,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty McSplatface." I'm concerned that the current marketing campaign isn't resonating with our target audience. I think we need to do a better job of highlighting the game's unique features and benefits.

I've attached a few ideas for how we could improve the campaign. I'd love to get your thoughts on these and discuss them further.

Let me know if you're free to chat sometime this week.

Thanks,
Ronan
