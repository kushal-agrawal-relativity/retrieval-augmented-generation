Hi Keenan,

I'm writing to you about the upcoming release of our new game, "Splatty's Adventure." I'm working on the software side of things, and I need your help with the account management side.

I'm specifically looking for someone to help us manage our relationships with our distributors. We need someone who can communicate with them effectively and resolve any issues that arise.

Do you think you'd be able to help us out with this? If so, please let me know and I can give you more details.

Thanks,
Ronan
