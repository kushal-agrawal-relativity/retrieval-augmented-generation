Hey Ronan,

I've been looking at the new level designs for the upcoming game, and I have a few thoughts I wanted to run by you.

First, I think the overall look and feel is great. The colors are really vibrant, and the characters are all very expressive. I'm particularly fond of the way you've designed the boss monster.

However, I have a few concerns about the level layout. I think some of the obstacles are too difficult, and there are a few places where it's easy to get lost. I'd like to work with you to see if we can make the levels a bit more accessible for players of all skill levels.

I'm also worried about the pacing of the game. I think it's a bit too slow in the beginning, and then it gets too fast towards the end. I think we could smooth out the pacing a bit by adding some more challenges in the middle of the game.

Overall, I think the game is looking great, and I'm excited to see it finished. I think these are just a few minor things that we can fix to make it even better.

Let me know what you think.

Damon
